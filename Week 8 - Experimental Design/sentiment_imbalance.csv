review,sentiment
"This movie had it all. I don't think it is any better than Infinity War but I don't think the two should even be compared. It's really a 7 hour movie, or a 7-episode final season of a TV series. What a way to end it.",1
"One of the best movies in its genre of the last 20 years. Your anticipation to go kick the bad guy's ass is skillfully levitated to an unforeseen height. Funny, thoughtful with only some time travelling inconsistencies that bothered me. Besides that, nearly perfect.",1
"I was ready for anything walking into Endgame, and while the towering 3+ hour run time was daunting, and the seemingly insurmountable pressure to outperform Infinity War, I had reservations. The cold-open to the film impressed me. Normally, there is bravado, fireworks, showcasing; this was the Russo's cherry on top of the 11 years of cakes after all. The opening scene set the tone and reminded me of what was lost, and followed up with the plain text title card of the movie. I thought it was immaculate, much like a lot of the ""moments"" in this movie. One thing that cannot be overlooked is that this is very much a finale. It's tying up all the loose ends that need to get sealed off, and it's non-traditional in the sense that it is essentially a victory lap for most of these characters. So in that sense, this movie is not so much a ""movie"", rather than a series of ""moments"", and I'll explain a bit on that. Some of the most impactful scenes resonated with me even several hours after the movie ended. When Cap confidently picked up Mjolnir and joined Thor in beating the crap out of Thanos with his half-broken shield - the audience collectively and audibly gasped. When a broken Thor tearfully stumbled over himself trying to save his mother, and she (accepting her fate) tells him that it's not for her to know. Piper tearfully telling Tony that he gets to rest, after the life from him slips away, following his heroic Thanos-dusting snap from his own gauntlet. The theater was so silent and the emotion was visceral. I could go on and on, but there are simply so many good moments in this film, it's impossible to detail them all without spending 3+ hours talking about them. The ending of the movie was predictable, but very much appropriate. It was safe, and the perfect end for Tony and Cap. Though maybe not as gravitas impactful as some of the other moments in the movie, it did remind me something that the entire series of MCU movies has preached to us: It's the journey that matters, not the destination. Endgame was a symphony of incredible moments, each hero stood out and showed they belonged - and in a cast this large, an incredible feat! I won't be rushing back to the theater to watch this again, not because the movie was bad - but because it was so completely satisfying. Like a traditional home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner, this movie left me without room for dessert, and I think that is perfectly fine. The only criticism the film is guilty of is shoe-horning social narratives in. I would have preferred to see a more organic relationship develop between the female heroes, instead of just throwing in a gratuitous ""she's got help"" and then arbitrarily grouping literally every single female cast member together who have seemingly not even met each other before. It felt extremely cliche, extremely trite and out of place in a movie that went out of it's way to explain a lot of complexities and give solid reasoning behind all of it's other decisions. The only other faux pas I can flag on this film is removing the emotion from the final Thanos fight. Plucking a Thanos who hasn't even found a single Infinity stone from history and making him face our heroes who have literally been morally and physically beaten by him, felt lackluster. Seeing Scarlet Witch just pouring out raw emotion and to have it met with ""I don't even know who you are!"" while comedic, fell flat with me. Thanos only realized that he ""won"", by getting all of the stones and snapping away half of the universe. He had no knowledge of the sacrifice or pain he personally inflicted on every single person in this movie and that was one moment that we will never get to see. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and I'm happy to see a true end to this fantastic series. It'll be difficult to rise to the heights of this again, and it's likely not something we will see again for another couple decades. So for now, enjoy the journey.",1
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Right from the start till the very end, it delivers, in every possible aspect of brilliant filming. Its ability to pull at your heart string is only surpassed by the incredible action and breath taking visual effects. This has to be the absolute best Superhero movie ever made. By a significant margin.",1
"Thought this movie was good but a little bit more boring than its predecessor. Some of the ideas were a little wonky and convoluted. The acting was good though, especially from Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. The movie made me cry quite a bit as it was truly the end of an era. Iron Man’s death was brutal, and Tom Holland’s acting during that point made me actually cry. The action and comedy were as good as any Marvel movie. It was a fine ending to a 21 movie long era and the result, while not perfect, checked most of the boxes and was satisfying.",1
Best Movie watched I liked the fight scene and stuff but have you consider ever eating cheese like have you ever wonder how cheese are made? I always wonder.......,1
Where have I been all this time?! This may be the best movie that I have ever seen!!!,1
The Best super-heroic movie EVER! The MOST Sentimental movie MCU has ever revealed. It's about 3 hours but you just get lost in the movie and suddenly find out the movie has finished. It makes you laugh and then brings your tears out and leaves you confused and stunned. EXCELLENT!!!,1
"It can feel a little odd to watch a movie for three hours without missing out on some critical details that can affect the movie in many different ways, but that would honestly be a lie if I would say that just to bring this film down. Marvel has built its world filled with iconic superheroes that we adore starting with Iron Man back in 2008 and now twenty-one films later, we're now seeing what is literally going to be the most epic final battle in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers: Endgame does not disappoint me when it came to telling its story during the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War and it shouldn't do the same thing to you too. You can easily tell that this is the most carefully detailed Marvel Cinematic Universe movie out of the rest of them and they put their best efforts of care into it resulting in a movie that feels more than just your average superhero movie. Definitely give this one a watch if you want to find a movie that feels more like an adventure than just a movie because you're basically not going to regret the ride.",1
Best Marvel Film Ever! Everyone who thinks that movie is boring doesn't understand the value of the movie,1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an excellent commercial movie,Marvel spent 10 years to prepare a wonderful show.Straightforward stories with a spectacular effects is good for every audiences.8.0 Great",1
"Avengers:Endgame historic performanceThis review was never about whether one should see this movie or how much money to spend. Standard, 3D, IMAX, or 4D, no matter how you see this movie it will be worth the money, regardless of whether you are a true fan or from the general population. This was further confirmed when all movie tickets were sold out 3 weeks prior to the opening weekend. But let’s talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heros, villians, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we’ve all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional rollercoaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn’t even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spiderman: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",1
"After being the 22nd movie in the franchise, it brings the series to new heights. This movie is best benefited by those who have watched most of, if not all of the Marvel films. Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future. This movie is a roller coaster which can be benefited most by those who have seen many of the other marvel films. Thank you to all those involved in the production of this movie, you have created a great films!",1
"A great ending to a long-running cinematic storyline. The acting was great, and the movie's length worked to its advantage to set scenes before diving into main plot points. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was stellar especially, and Tom Holland was especially enjoyable during the final, chaotic fight scene. It is not a perfect movie, but a great watch with a tear-jerking ending, a great end to Tony Stark's character arc.",1
Avengers: Endgame is my new favorite movie of all time! It is just amazing!,1
An epic end to over ten years of MCU movies as the arc of the Avengers comes to an end.  This movie is long and I understand it but they could have cut 30 mins. and still told the story just fine three hours just a little long.  It is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of the Marvel Universe.,1
"This movie brought me to tears; several times. When a movie cultivates that much emotion in someone, I declare it as an incredible work of art (or amazing marketing). It never ceased to entertain me and it interested me until the end. The only thing that keeps me from saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, or at least of the 21st Century, is that one must watch all of the 20+ movies beforehand in order to fully feel for the characters and be encompassed by the beauty of what the MCU has come to be. All in all, I would suggest this film to anyone, Marvel fan, movie fan, or bum (because that is the only other thing you can be if you are not the other two).",1
"This movie was amazing from start to finish. It was filled with heart, action and altogether a great sense of closure. Although there were some plot holes scattered throughout the movie and slightly less Iron Man fight scenes than I would've hoped for, it still ticks practically every box that I was after and is a great sendoff to the Avengers franchise.",1
"This is a tricky one to write when many people have still not seen the film, so no worries if you are reading this, there will be no spoilers. Look for the spoilers on The 602 Club podcast next Tuesday. If you listen to my podcasts or have read this blog, you know I am not afraid to be critical of Marvel movies when I feel it is warranted. Case in point, I felt like Infinity War was, “… a mixed bag that has the effect of one being served a gourmet burger and then only being given a minute to eat it. There is so much happening, yet there’s so little pay off, leaving the audience unfulfilled, wanting a better movie and resolution. We all know the conclusion is coming in 2019, so now that the compulsory is over, we wait and wait and wait.” It was frustrating to feel this way, specifically since I just didn’t feel much about the movie, other than ambivalence and this left me trepidatious for Endgame.So with that preamble, I know you are are all waiting eagerly for my thoughts on the end of the Infinity Stone Saga…. it is satisfying. That’s really what we want after this twenty-one film, eleven year investment, right? We want to be satisfied emotionally and thankfully Endgame is everything Infinity War was not in that department. The movie will capture you from start to finish. Personally I am happy with where my favorite characters are at the end and that is enough.With the three hour run time and the contrivances to overcome Thanos, there are some issues. The movie does feel a bit long, but it also plays out better than Infinity War. Where that movie left you feeling unable to focus because there were so many characters and not a moments rest, Endgame is able to take its time. This may be it’s greatest strength, that you don’t feel rushed, you’re allowed the opportunity to care about what’s happening because you’re not being whiplashed between stories every other minute. For my book, Endgame is the poignantly satisfying conclusion to this part of the Marvel saga I wanted. It is not the perfect movie but it’s the one we deserve. Endgame is rate 4 out of 5 Cap Shields.",1
"Had so many emotions while watching this. Great ending for a generation of movies. Still, so many charaters had to stay in the background because 3-hour movie is not enough.",1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is nothing short of a spectacle that serves as a poignant and deserving conclusion to the legendary  ""Avengers"" saga that defined a generation, not unlike ""Return of the Jedi"".",1
"Avenger's to me was a great movie, here's why, Marvel Studios brought back the nostalgia feel and them going back in time made it feel like all the OG movie's in one. The comedy was perfect for me as I myself am a funny guy.(not really) I defeintly loved the conclusion's to the character's and the scene where all your favorite hero's are together.",1
Greatest Marvel Movie ever. Infinity war was amazing but Endgame tops it no doubt.,1
"Very good overall though a little too long, the 'Time Heist' was a bit silly and some characters got too much screen time at the expense of others e.g. the awful Nebula is critical to the plot while we don't really get The Hulk.",1
"Good conclusion to an awesome sega, story was good. Action was great. At the same time the pacing was terrible. But still very good.",1
A movie that leaves a lot of emotions. Hope for the return of Iron Man and I don't know where Loki will get the infinity stone,1
"Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic and emotion conclusion to the Infinity Saga, and the beginning of the future of the MCU. Avengers: Endgame provides funny, heart-wrenching, and beautiful storytelling that's full of satisfaction. Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth are fantastic in their respective roles, and the return of Tom Holland, Tessa Thompson, Chadwick Boseman and others, is fantastic. This movie is for all to love and enjoy!",1
I'm interested in this amazing blockbuster movie from MCU.In the end of the line this is a good endgame for marvel...,1
"Best marvel film to come out to this date. It is extraordinary, mind boggling, you will definitely get lots of goosebumps. 10/10 for sure. If u like my review plz follow my i.g. account @waridude. If u dont like my review just follow me anyways",1
"Good, a solid movie that reconnet and offer closure to some aspects of the franchise...after about 10 years of Marvel cinematic universe it wasn't an easy task to accomplish. Kudos to that.  But It's a little inferior to Infinity war or Avengers 1:Some parts are well made but other not so much...like the majority of the humorous parts (too many and too silly). Thor and Hulk are really bad represented here.Other than that it's a must watch..the day after the movie premiere I spotted people (and tv news) in my country talking about superheroes and not about the last soccer match...for and old nerd like me It's a little revolution...and in a good way.",1
"Disclosure: I'm NOT a Marvel superfan, but I've seen all the movies, starting with Iron Man (actually, starting with Howard the Duck), and I was starting to get tired of these. However, this is a really good movie. A little bloated at 3 hours, yes, and it takes almost a full hour to really kick into gear, but they writers/director do an excellent job wrapping things up.  Some truly touching moments, and some extremely funny moments.  (""Hello Jeff Lebowsky!"") I though Capt. Marvel was given a short shrift, but I suppose that makes sense given her late entry in the series in general.  Clearly, we're not going to be seeing certain character(s) after this film, but I think it's deftly handled for maximum emotional payoff.  In my theater, there were belly laughs, cheers, and ugly cries.  Can't expect much more than that in a big budget flick, huh?",1
Pretty **** good I mean sure Black Widow died and Stark(LOVE3000)but like yknow worst case scenario they milk this franchise,1
"Avengers: Endgame. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. It takes you through a emotional rollercoaster with references sprinkled throughout, bringing you back to where it all began but has a few moments which make it just short of a 10.Captain Marvel was not needed in the movie and served as a ex machina, ruining one of the most epic scene in movie history where earth teams up to defeat thanos and destroys his spaceship in a scene that looked like a reskin of the last jedi which as we know, was not received so well. There were also some inconsistencies throughout the movie with some power scaling problems. An example is Captain America fighting past thanos and getting flung across but was able to handle his infinity gauntlet punch in infinity war? He was also able to summon mjonir because he was worthy, but if he could, why couldn't others? Thor was also seen fat but still was able to fit in his armor and time suit? I understand the material of the time suit might be flexible but armor doesn't have flexibility so we are supposed to assume he just burned fat in a day? Enough of negatives, let's get to the good parts!Throwbacks really caused me to tear up, especially the time travel back to guardians of the galaxy and original avengers as we've known them throughout all these years and movies. Humour was executed greatly in a movie with such a serious tone but worked. Occasionally throwing in jokes helps viewers recover. It is filled with fan service rewarding old fans but not alienating new fans with a simple plot and was sad to see such characters as Captain America go, seeing how they grew but passing on the torch to newcomers to the marvel franchise and I'm looking forward to see what they do next after thanos. We also continue to see the humanity of thanos and him breaking throughout the course of the MCU. We can see that he wanted to eliminate half the universe and when earth revolts, he offers a different solution but the goal stays the same, to let life live in an utopia and achieve peace which is reasonable, and how much he was willing to sacrifice, almost dying to destroy the stones themselves instead of keeping it with him as they served no purpose, showing his humanity and that he cared for people.Endgame also gave finality to the whole series when people started to say that they were the same movies over and over again and although I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from. Just hearing the theme and seeing the avengers team up for one last time was purely amazing and epic with a good ending. Having no end credit or mid credit scene might seem lazy or usual, I believe that that's intentional as they don't want it to be some opener for a bigger movie but an great end to a even greater series.Marvel, I love you 3000. 9/10",1
"Avengers Endgame is one of the very few movies that I can watch over and over again based on it's amazing story, humor and action. The final battle is the best final battle against a villain that I have seen ever. 9/10 for me.",1
Solid finish to the MCU. Glad there won't be any more movies in the franchise.Could have been a solid 10 if they cut 15 minutes of 'woke' footage.,1
"The second best superhero movie I've see, after infinity war. Takes a while to get going, lots of false finishes and trips to the past, but overall a very fine send off for iron man and captain america. Three hours long, but the time flew by. Marvel are knocking it out of the park at the moment, I can't think of a better way to find escapism at the movies.",1
"The time has come. The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)  to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend,  Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It  put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+",1
"As much as I would love to, I don’t want the current generation of MCU's characters to end. We all loved Robert Downey's Ironman, Chris Evans’ Captain America, and they left a mark in our hearts that can never be replaced. I will root for the next phase of MCU movies, but I don’t think it will have the same allure as the first one.",1
"Masterpiece? Not at all.But it's definitely a satisfying conclusion. The movie has flaws, but there so many good things about it, especially the last chapter, i got goosebumps like never before :)I definitely recommend it!",1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably one of Marvel's best movies yet. It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all  the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying ""there's wine on the ship."" Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life.Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have.",1
"This review contains spoilers...For a 3 hour movie there is surprisingly little action. Central characters like Thor and the Hulk did hardly anything and were just lame. Captain Marvel was supposed to be their knight in shining armour but she was hardly in it at all and at the end fails to best Thanos one on one, even though she's just blasted through the middle of a giant space cruiser. I really thought she would be his downfall. If you're going to hype her up that much, make sure she's really a solid element of the film. Too much dialogue, too many sentimental moments. Ending it on Tony's Stark's funeral was just a downer when really you wanted some real cathartic, happy times after the bleakness of Infinity War. It's not even clear how Stark gets the stones from Thanos as one minute they're lodged in this glove and then next minute Stark has them without you even knowing why. Annoying that Black Widow has to die and they couldn't figure out another way to get the soul stone. Hawkeye's rage filled murdering spree near the beginning feels kind of forced and weird. Stupid humour that went way over the top, like Thor becoming a complete loser. It was funny for the first five minutes but when you realised how much they'd nerfed his powers you just felt disappointed, especially after how badass he was in Ragnarok. He was almost discounted from contributing altogether and was just pathetic. Stark's banter with his daughter was just cringey. Why did hulk wearing the infinity gauntlet for 10 seconds manage to restore the earth again? That wasn't explained but maybe I missed it. This always happens, when the hype is so high things go the other way. Captain Marvel's movie was dire as well. For me, although DC have a worse track record, Marvel still haven't topped Wonder Woman. Their new joker movie looks top notch too. Just hoping Guardians 3 is good.",-1
"After enjoying Infinity War tremendously last year, I was quite shocked how mediocre and boring Endgame had become in comparison. Marvel movies really start to fail my expectations and I need a break from them.",-1
"Speaking of Gomorrah, seeing her again was great, but they wasted it. TBH, Nebula was great and the stark contrast in the progression of her character, from her interactions with Tony at the very beginning to her and Gomorrah on Thanos’s ship, was really compelling. However, Gomorrah really disappointed me. She has so much depth and tension in her character and they explored it really well in Infinity War, when Quill tried to kill her, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in this one, she changed her mind about her father REAL quick and OFF SCREEN and was really a throwaway character despite the fact that her death was one of the true deaths of infinity war and one of the most beautifully tragic moments for Thanos and humanized him. If they aren’t going to bring her back and give her a real touching moment, then just give her an Easter egg like with Loki and Thor, which was a great moment and really hit the nostalgia. Which brings me to the biggest plot confusion of the movie, which I was thinking about the entire time - isn’t it really hard for a human to hold an infinity stone? They made a huge **** deal about it in Guardians of the Galaxy, and they talked mad **** about how powerful they were, and yet all 13 of the **** were tossing them around like nothing?Furthermore, giving the Hulk the first snap is a **** disgrace, but I’m biased because I hate the Hulk. Bruce and the Hulk combined, great for him, is an obvious culmination of the entire Hulk storyline as a final resolution to his constant warring over the two halves of him, but he’s not a compelling character, he has no depth and he’s pretty **** useless in battle, but he got the snap and survived because he’s super strong!!!! At that point in the movie I was thinking that the director’s were just like “let’s just give them all something so we can end this **** series and move the **** on”. On an aesthetic note, one thing that I thought was so great about Thor Ragnorak and Infinity War were the great, artistic, and cinematic moments when some big, movie changing **** was happening (Thor’s lightning scene jesus **** But Hulk’s snap was in that white ass, clinically lit room in such a tight shot, and you only know it worked because of **** Hawkeye, whose wife is calling him, who once again I will say I don’t give a singular **** about. It just seemed such a far cry from Thanos’s snap moment, and Iron Man’s final snap which were given the time and artistry that they deserved, considering they were LITERALLY movie changing scenes. Speaking of important, climactic scenes scenes, I feel like Captain Marvel wasn’t wonderfully incorporated. She seems to be a very divisive character, from people hating her standalone movie to the rumors that the cast hated Brie Larson, but honestly, if she could knock Thanos out and give him a fair fight, where was she this whole time? She is literally supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe, and she was on the sidelines for the majority of this movie. I will admit there were great scenes, like any Tony/Peter interaction and Cap finally getting his dance with Peggy. These are things that the fans of the MCU have probably been asking for since forever, and getting these moments was quite satisfying. However, Cap being able to wield Thor’s hammer, which happens in the comics and is quite a popular demand of the Russo brothers, was not well explained. Especially with all the **** that Thor went through, giving up this moment for him was a little bit devastating for a Thor fan, and ultimately made me feel like this movie did him SO **** DIRTY. Obviously that moment has its fans and it was pretty well done cinematically, but if Cap is holding Mjolnir, he has the power of Thor, making Thor pretty extraneous in this movie. Also, when was he deemed worthy (tbh I don’t love Cap and knowing all the **** Thor went through to get Mjolnir back when he wasn’t worthy it feels a little bit quick/rushed/convenient/lazy). I think that they could have left many things out (them listing time travel movies, as funny as that is, was at least 5 minutes of my life I could have gotten back) in favor of spending more time developing our last moments with these original Avengers that have shaped our modern conception of superheroes. I went in with incredibly high expectations, and this movie fell quite short of them, but honestly, it gave a lot of lip service to what the fans wanted, to a point where the movie just felt like funny clips strung together by a flimsy plot line. And it was a funny movie - to a point where every serious or dark or tragic movie was almost immediately undercut with levity. Ultimately I think this movie had to do too much and didn’t have the time or bandwidth to do it all perfectly, and I’ll miss all the original Avengers despite the failings of this movie. [2/2]",-1

"Crazy disappointing is probably the best way I can describe this movie. I feel like giving it a 2, but to be fair a 6 is probably what it deserves. The reason I feel like giving this movie such a low score is because it was so hyped for so long building anticipation and then totally mailing it in. I admit I am a huge comic book fan and because of this I have seen every MCU movies with the exception of only making it about 75% of the way through Captain Marvel. I have become much more lenient on expecting movies to follow comic book plots and even encouraged change if I thought it was for the better. In this case they had a perfect example to adapt from in Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series. I already knew from the first part IW and due to contractual obligations these movies would be much different from the comics, but I was not expecting this. This movie throws away all the awesome scenes from the comic to replace them with lame callbacks to old movies, dragging characters through the mud like Thor and Hulk and setting things up for the ANAD Marvel characters in the future which are the worst of all the comic characters (Thanks Disney). The time travel plot was lame poorly executed and riddled this thing with plot holes. Most of the movie was boring and I felt no emotional investment. Characters I have loved fro more than 20 years died or had their final big moments in this film and I felt nothing because it was so poorly executed. I am not arrogant enough as a comic book fan to say I will never watch another MCU movie again with some of my favorite characters like Doctor Doom and the X-men joining, but I plan on skipping a lot of these until they prove to me they have their **** together.",-1

The only redeeming factors being a few decent jokes, The first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes.Extremely overhyped and really just for the casual Marvel audience. Two extra hours of lame fan service. Disappointing. If I was new to Marvel I understand why it's big but I'm not. It's generic if anything.",-1
Avengers Endgame was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever spent in a movie theatre. The entire movie is boring except for about the last 20 minutes. The writing is horrible and everything is explained through pure luck and **** Sounds like they forced Thanos to lose in every possible way.

"A little bit of a let down after everything leading up to it. I would have given it a much higher score regardless, if Marvel hadn't put their political agenda's in the film. -They have a scene where they throw in a gay character with absolutely no benefit to the movie, then never seen again. -Then there was Brie Larson at it again. Thank goodness they gave her barely any screen time. Unfortunately that was too much screen time. Every comment she made was condescending, arrogant, and annoying. Terrible Character. Marvel should have definitely used this movie as a way to kill her off from the series. -Then this obsession with empowering all the female characters. In fact they have this one horrible scene where Captain Marvel is trying to get the gauntlet through Thanos' army and only all the female character line up together to protect the gauntlet and back her up. I could totally imagine a ""Girl Power"" banner in the background. I did a face palm in the theater.-Going along with empowering females, they also make the male characters useless. Hulk is worse in this movie then he was Infinity War, except now they also screwed up Thor. Besides Iron Man, Thor was the only other person who deserved to win this. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him a fat, alcoholic, useless, and unmotivated character full of insecurities. He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in fact he gave away what he already had (such as the visions and coming in to save the day in Infinity Wars).-The rest of the male characters where all very submissive and weak around the females while the women acted strong and NEVER once showed any weakness.-They ruin this movie with PC cultural and Feminism once again (not sure why they haven't learned from the Captain Marvel flop). I am no longer going to be seeing Marvel movies in the theaters, they are becoming corrupted by this liberal junk. I go to watch movies to enjoy myself. Not to get political correctness and feminism rammed in my face.",-1

"I finally watched this movie.  And I came away terribly disappointed.  Infinity War barely held its story together and allowed some characters to shine.  This sequel seemed to be written and directed by people with Attention-Deficit Disorder.  It jumped from one set of heroes to another entirely different set not once or twice but several times.  They kept changing the nonsensical time-travel rules to fit whatever the writers wanted to happen next.  There was never any core group of lead characters for the viewer to latch onto and to actually care about.  This unfocused and nonsense ruined any feelings of danger or threat.  So, when the strongest women in the universe saved the day I no longer cared.  Blow the Earth up!  Who cares!  They'll just go back in time again and start over.  Maybe with better writing.",-1
"Endgame is a mess. The only positive things that I have to say is the character development, I only like the the character development because of the fact about how many people they have to remember. Now the negative stuff.

Black widow. Here is a bit more respect to marvel most of the time I think black widow is wasted but in endgame she had a decent role before she died. Professor hulk,  professor hulk was a nerdy mess the cgi at some points almost made me puke. The pacing was okay, but now the big daddy the plot holes. The plot holes were almost as bad as the ones in captain Marvel here are some I found in the first 30 minutes.

"Avengers:Endgame is the culmination of over a decade of work, and while that is admirable (and I have enjoyed it thoroughly for the most part) Endgame felt to me like every one wanted to stand around and part themselves on the back for 3 hours.There were parts of genuine emotion, humor and tragedy, but it really felt like Disney were saying 'Goodbye' to an older product line and 'Hello' to new planks in the franchise building model.I guess we will never know what the Russo brothers could have done if Disney had taken the handcuffs off - they were brilliant in The Winter Soldier - because the movie spent so long establishing new settings and characters for the next phase of the MCU.  New Captain America, Loki disappears with the Tessaract, the Asgardians of the Galaxy, Gentle Hulk ... everywhere you look there is a new movie in the works.  Disney has shown a shocking lack of awareness when it comes to their cash cows - they managed to torpedo the Star Wars franchise after couple of movies - and it looks like they won't be stopping any time soon with the MCU, Black Widow, Gaurdians 3, Spiderman:Far From Home all the works and the feeling of franchise fatigue is well and truly settling in.The movie itself isn't terrible.  It has some really good parts, but it's just kind of a mess.  It flips from tragic, to heroic, to suspense without really knowing if the emotions have landed, or if you even care.  Thor going back and having a moment with his mother is a scene with genuine emotion, then having Hulk and Black Widow barely acknowledge each other in the aftermath of the dusting is completely ridiculous (remember when they were an item? What the hell happened to that? Wouldn't a galaxy spanning tragedy pull the survivors closer together?)  Ugh, it's a series of moments stitched together to create a spectacle but it doesn't really make for a great viewing experience.  Speaking of viewing - did it feel to anyone else that they kind of got to the end of production, saw some of the CGI and went ""Eh, that'll do""?  Because there are scenes that are jarring in the uneven production values of the imagery.  Most scenes are done well, but there is the odd scene where it is really noticeable that they haven't brought their A game.After the initial adrenaline rush of viewing it for the first time, I was struck by how disappointed I felt in the movie.  It had all the elements of a great movie, and yet seemed to be a bit tone deaf in the execution.  And after all the crashing and exploding were finished, the Russo's went full Peter Jackson and spent half an hour at the end giving every character full fan service (complete with nameplate and signatures in the credits).  They should have called the movie Avengers: Curtain Call, and it would have been more appropriate.The one thing it does do is create an end.  Stark sacrificing himself for the greater good sees the full character arc of Tony complete.  He was the first, and most important, Avenger and the MCU won't be the same without him.  (Note: With the introduction of Time travel, it's not like they're just gonna let him stay dead if the box office starts to suffer).So if you're invested in the series, go see it.  It's not for you if you haven't been keeping up with the movies though, as the movie expects you to have a pretty thorough knowledge of the happenings in the MCU up to this point.Welcome to the MCU, where the characters are made up and the plot doesn't matter.",-1
"So I went into this not expecting much, and really not knowing much about the universe. (Only watched the first two...got dragged into this by my boyfriend)There’s several issues with these movies that explain my score;- they spend far too time coming up with an hour worth of cheesy jokes that the movies feel to drag on and on.- Several of the action scenes scream B-movie cheese (Japanese scene (unneeded), several fight scenes toward the end)- They made captain America at the end seem like he went from 100% saving the world/perhaps resurrecting Iron Man to “nope screw people I’m retiring”- A lot of bad acting as usual in these kind of movies- they make alcoholism seem like it’s okay and something to joke aboutCouple pros:- some of the more well done action scenes were fantastic, visually pleasing- Robert Downey Jr and Peter Parker (forgot the actors name) at the end had a fantastic performance",-1
"The first movie was WAY better.  Just wanted to get that off my chest from the start. There was to much sarcasm, jokes, and general nonsense throughout the movie.  While the first film had you on the edge of your seat, this movie seems to do everything it can to take the nervous anticipation completely out of the film.  The middle of the movie REALLY dragged on.  My wife was actually glad she needed to use the bathroom so she'd have an excuse to step away.  My wife and I are big comic book hero fans, and actually collect comic books together, but we were off and on board throughout the middle 1.5 hrs of the film.  They have this ONE chance to turn everything around to bring back those they loved, but every 5-10 minutes, the cast are making light of their situation.  It just really ruined the immersion, and tension that SHOULD have been surrounding their perilous journey.  Captain Marvel/Brie Larson felt SO out of place in the film.  They literally threw her into every scene she was in, but it didn't feel as if she should be there.  There was no emotional connection to her at all even though she basically saved the Avengers.  The way the final battle went down up to the conclusion seemed rushed after having sat their for 2hr 45 min with little to no action.  After the final battle, the reminiscing sequence afterward lasted forever, and we were ready to leave once the battle concluded, but there's like 20 more minutes afterward that didn't feel needed.  Lastly, Ill only say that the sequence towards the end with Captain America passing on the reigns to another character was one of the biggest liberal pandering segments I have ever seen in a movie, and left a REAL bad taste in my mouth at the end.  Why can't films leave politics OUT.  So tired of it.  Anyway, I wanted to give the film a better score, but it simply doesn't deserve it.  We actually thought we'd go see this a few times like we did with Infinity War, but we have no interest in sitting through another minute of this movie until maybe its released on video.",-1
"While this movie brought me to tears a few times, it was ruined with just a few shots for me at least. Just take the shot where all the women save spiderman. Why? How? When? Where? That was so horrible, it deserved at least two points down for the movie. Another two points down for that Captain Marvel saves everyone moment. Like, really? I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",-1

From what i understood, only half of the living beeings was anihilated, so why in this movie, Earth looks deserted, like it was ninety percent? The rest of the movie was just meh.  There were some good emotional moments, but most just made me roll my eyes. All in all i didn't enjoy most of the movie - probably becouse i got so tired with it's first 1,5h. Liked the ending.",-1

"Avengers Endgame feels like a movie where Marvel is patting itself on the back, good job! I don’t think there’s been a Marvel movie that has disappointed me more than this one. Last year’s Infinity War was great, everything was put together after ten years and it had a fantastic ending, a cliffhanger that had us all wanting more. The dramatic ending in infinity war is completely thrown away. Like my god, every real dramatic moment that was happening in Endgame was thrown away with humor. Literally would it be so bad for people to just be miserable, they toss in these stupid one liner’s in every scene, maybe its just me and I find it forced and not funny, but the obnoxious woman sitting behind me was cackling throughout. But really 5 years into the future the Hulk would still be dabbing? Really? Are people even dabbing now anymore? Captain America admiring his butt, Thor with anything he said, and Black Widow staring into the distance trying to cry for Clint while holding back a smile. Humor shouldn’t be used to take viewers out of uncomfortable situations, what’s the point of a dangerous battle for a viewer when they are constantly molded to feel safe with some joke to kill the seriousness. Let’s talk feminism and the pat on the back. During the big fight scene, they took time out to have all the woman stand together to fight Thanos, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. Really? That’s showing how progressive marvel is, that shot is an insult considering only one of those women has been a lead in her own film. Marvel pat yourself on the back again, yay Girl Power and your trailblazing feminism.  That moment could’ve been so much better had they fought him and showcased their strengths, showing woman are equally good fighters to their male counterparts. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest super heroes in the whole MCU and she was probably on screen for ten minutes of the 3-hour runtime. But to literally have them come together during this massive fight for that shot is lazy filmmaking. I want one person to tell me they weren’t taken out of the film to consider all the woman were standing together. It killed the momentum in the battle. Risk and reward, Marvel/Disney usually doesn’t do well in this area. Star Wars Episode 8 was fantastic because things were at stake and viewers weren’t just given what they wanted, look at all the complaint they received for it. I really feel episode 9 will be like Endgame in that it gives viewers everything with little to no surprises. Endgame plays everything safe, even when situations are risky they are still safe. You know everything will turn out fine. Yes, there are a few deaths but nothing we weren’t expecting going in. And most of the deaths have already been reversed. Black Widow gets her own series on Disney+. The Characters, in the ten plus years and twenty plus movies, how many characters can you say have grown? Have changed with everything that has happened to them? No character has really felt or dealt with the fallout of anything that has happened to them in previous films. If they have it was for a short period of time because on the other side of the fallout the characters are right back where they started. On a side note with infinity war they finally made Thor cool. With this movie they took ten steps back and made him a dislikable character.I’ve always felt that superhero movies are only as good as their villains. (ex. Dark Knight, Spider man Homecoming) Infinity War made Thanos a great adversary with depth, he had purpose. Endgame made him a caricature of a villain we will forgot about after the credit’s role. That ending and another example of dumbing it down for audiences. The perfect ending would’ve been Steve Rogers going back in time and sitting on the park bench as an old man. Boom! there you go; the audience is smart enough to figure out what happened. Instead they drag the film for some talk between Cap and Falcon. Then they cut to show you where other characters are at and that everything will be okay. Everything is spelled out for the viewers so don’t fret we’re all in a happy place. Like my previous paragraph no one seemed to be affected by everything that happened. I could be wrong, but I guess we will see when the next phase of movies starts rolling out. Now don’t get me wrong there are moments and scenes in this movie I enjoyed. The time travel to the 70s with Cap and Iron man was great. It’s not all bad but the things I dislike are overshadowing the things I liked.The more days I sit with this film the more I dislike it and the hype machine it has become. There’s no substance to anything in this film. When I see people saying this should get nominated for an Oscar, I want people to ponder if they’ll remember anything about this movie in 10 years or even 1 year. In closing here’s one more pat on the back, congrats to the people at Marvel/Disney.",-1
"Contains essentially what JUSTICE LEAGUE (even the dreadful, Warner's-mangled first version) does, and with the same bombast Zack Snyder has (sometimes quite fairly) been accused of.  Overstuffed with Marvel's crew to the point where the individualism the brand has been lauded for is all but lost, the final battle seems stretched and inconsequential.  Any comparison with Snyder's corrected version of HIS apocalyptic showdown will show (as it has ever since DC learned--yes, largely from Marvel--that character is the key to storytelling), just how shallow Endgame really is.",-1

"When half of the universe has been wiped out, when your dear ones were gone and when all hopes have been faded, don’t worry, just ask a big green guy to help you travelling the time and all your problems will be solved. That basically sums up the film. All’s well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life in an Armageddon’s Bruce Willis style to save the universe…how original! All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000’s superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time. Better on the form nothing on the substance if you ask me. But well, to each his own!",-1
"A good ending for Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. Those 3 Battling Thanos at the same time was the best thing in the movie. Hulk was hilarious, i wish he got to fight Thanos too. Hawk Eye were finally used properly. But there was alot more bad than good in this movie. The Female Avengers Movie setup felt so forced no ones excited for that. Pepper Pots as Iron Man again? it didnt work in Iron Man 3 and it dam sure is not going to work in future movies. Captain Marvel, shes is just the worst..too OP to care about her future movies. Judging by the direction they are going, i see that this is the last Marvel Movie i will ever need to see. Its been fun.",-1
"It was an OK movie. Dialogue and character interactions were good, time travel was established quite well and referances were great. However the movie was just a fan service composed of moderate drama and comedy. The MVP were Nebula, Nat, Clint and Tony. Steve was OK and got a somewhat decent ending. Hulk was mediocre and Thor was straight trash. Overall, movie was boring and too much over-hyped. Storytelling was nowhere near Infinity War and plot was nothing extraordinary. Thanos became a casual Marvel villain unlike his counterpart in Infinity War. This time he had no depth, minimal emotion and an unimpressive arc. My score is 5/10. Mostly because of how well Russo's dealt with time travel and our lesser hero got moments to shine. Unfortunately rest of the heroes were uninteresting and useless.",-1
This is a good superheroes film but it can be an excellent movie if they removed the time travel element/plot from the movie.

"Never felt like I could roll my eyes so much at such a comedic disaster. Yes the film uses nostalgia to wink at the audience every five minutes but this does nothing but make the film look like just another CGI overhaul fan film that gives its previous instalment (infinty war) little impact. The character deaths were predictable as was the plot, to be honest I had been waiting for iron mans death since five years ago, he's a cool character, but severely overhyped and overused at this point. As I mention the comedy is tragically bad, with every character suddenly pulling terrible jokes out of ""americas ass"" as Ant man puts it. I mean seriously, Thor the God of Thunder is now an overweight drunk playing fortnite?",-1
Thank God it's finally over. Infinity Wars was a rarity in the superhero world in having a real flesh and blood antagonist with depth. But they turned Thanos into cardboard in Endgame. Big budget junk food in visual form. Totally forgettable.I'll give points for technical proficiency but for the 3 hours of smaltz and saccharin mawkishness I'll give nothing.,-1

This movie was way too slow and too long. I don't mind a movie that is slow if it has great dialogue and characters. But I'm not a huge fan of most of the superheroes in Avengers. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be deeply invested in all of them. The only interest I had was with Thanos. The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.,-1
Time travel is the laziest style of writing. It is like the ridiculous force healing in Rise of Skywalker. A decent movie but not worth the hype.,-1
this movie was so much **** i loved infinity war but this was garbage. the pinnacle definitive moment no spoilers is black widow and nighthawk trying to kill each other to prove who loves who the most.,-1
I feel like my biggest problem with this movie is simply the fact the first half is way longer then it needs to be. I feel like it was drawn out simply so they could make a big show about how the movie is three hours long. Besides that though the movies pretty good. Exactly what most people want out of a marvel movie with the same problems and that's perfectly fine. A fitting end to this era of marvel films.,-1

The reason I feel like giving this movie such a low score is because it was so hyped for so long building anticipation and then totally mailing it in. I admit I am a huge comic book fan and because of this I have seen every MCU movies with the exception of only making it about 75% of the way through Captain Marvel. I have become much more lenient on expecting movies to follow comic book plots and even encouraged change if I thought it was for the better. In this case they had a perfect example to adapt from in Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series. I already knew from the first part IW and due to contractual obligations these movies would be much different from the comics, but I was not expecting this. This movie throws away all the awesome scenes from the comic to replace them with lame callbacks to old movies, dragging characters through the mud like Thor and Hulk and setting things up for the ANAD Marvel characters in the future which are the worst of all the comic characters (Thanks Disney). The time travel plot was lame poorly executed and riddled this thing with plot holes. Most of the movie was boring and I felt no emotional investment. Characters I have loved fro more than 20 years died or had their final big moments in this film and I felt nothing because it was so poorly executed. I am not arrogant enough as a comic book fan to say I will never watch another MCU movie again with some of my favorite characters like Doctor Doom and the X-men joining, but I plan on skipping a lot of these until they prove to me they have their **** together.",-1
"Ah, Avengers: Endgame. The movie that the world was waiting for for about 10 years now? Anyways, let's get straight to the point. This movie is an extremely mixed bag for me. While there's many moments in here that are just breath-taking and badass, there's also a large number of scenes that just had me cringing.First off, let's go over the positives. For anyone who has watched the movie, you know how awesome it was to see Captain America pick up Mjolnir and wail on Thanos. It was a very awe-inspiring scene and was just overall REALLY a fun watch. Similarly to this but with more consequence, when Iron Man acquired the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos' forces away, that was also just as if not possibly more epic than Capt. America's feat of fighting Thanos with Mjolnir. Was also fun to see Ant-Man knock down a Chitari flying whale with just his giant form, but that's just me fanboying Ant-Man.Another positive is the character arcs that both Capt. America and Iron Man go through over the course of the movie as they re-meet old friends and family as they travel across time trying to re-acquire the Infinity Stones. Now onto the negatives, and oh boy is there a bit to cover.First off, this movie, no matter how many people might tell you otherwise, is FULL of SJW moments very clearly. Let's list them off, shall we?:1. Thor, the white male that he is, has grown to be a lardy alcoholic in this movie that apparently can't even take on base Thanos while Capt. Marvel can effortlessly tank a headbutt from Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet? Nice clear SJWism.2. During the middle of the fight with Thanos, a bunch of the superwomen gather up together and start to wail on Thanos' forces, while all the men're just sitting in the sidelines like a bunch of sissies. This just goes to show the same ol', same ol' trope of ""GIRL POWERRRR!"" in modern Mary Sue-filled movies.3. Another showing of feminist/SJW propaganda in this movie is Thor just randomly handing off the title of king of Asgard to the random Valkyrie chick we met and saw only a few movies ago. All of that after seeing him become a tub of lard? His character ruined? It's quite pathetic what they did to him, now he just runs around with the Guardians of the Galaxy and'll do who knows what for who knows how long.4. Capt. America handing off the title of, well, Capt. America to a black guy, specifically Falcon, is another showing of stupid disregard for character in exchange for blatant SJW propaganda. Honestly, it's completely out-of-character for Steve to hand out the shield to Falcon instead of Bucky. He very clearly has a much bigger and better relationship with Bucky, so why hand it to Falcon? It's just dumb and completely takes you out of the otherwise surreal experience of seeing Cap as an oldie.I could go on and on about why SJWism is what's ruining this movie, but it has flaws even aside from that. The movie is very uneventful, and very boring as a result. Many a moment, I'd find myself just wanting the movie to be over so I could take a bathroom break. And many of my friends have made the same claims. It's just not as fun to watch as the other movies, minus those few moments Cap and Iron Man had near the end of the film (but we know what happened to both of them, now don't we?).If you just want to finish off the Marvel movies with a bit of a banger, this is the movie for you. It has some badass moments for many fan favs like Cap and Iron Man, and really builds up the fanservice with the final fight.All this considered however, the movie is absolutely LITTERED with SJW garbage that really detracts from the experience for someone with more right-leaning viewpoints. If you're one of those kinda people like me, do or don't see this movie, but most certainly avoid the assuredly SJW phase 4 of the MCU Marvel Studios will be churning out in the not-so-distant future.",-1
"Never felt like I could roll my eyes so much at such a comedic disaster. Yes the film uses nostalgia to wink at the audience every five minutes but this does nothing but make the film look like just another CGI overhaul fan film that gives its previous instalment (infinty war) little impact. The character deaths were predictable as was the plot, to be honest I had been waiting for iron mans death since five years ago, he's a cool character, but severely overhyped and overused at this point. As I mention the comedy is tragically bad, with every character suddenly pulling terrible jokes out of ""americas ass"" as Ant man puts it. I mean seriously, Thor the God of Thunder is now an overweight drunk playing fortnite?",-1
Are they going to make a part 2? They need to consider doing one if they don't want all those past films to end on a fail.,-1
Thank God it's finally over. Infinity Wars was a rarity in the superhero world in having a real flesh and blood antagonist with depth. But they turned Thanos into cardboard in Endgame. Big budget junk food in visual form. Totally forgettable.I'll give points for technical proficiency but for the 3 hours of smaltz and saccharin mawkishness I'll give nothing.,-1
"This film was could've been one hour shorter than what they made it, so it got super boring in some parts and it felt like nothing was happening most of the time. I lost interest in the movie about an hour into it. And it was way to complicated to keep up with a of the characters and their relationships and separate missions and desires. this movie also had way to many jokes, this is a problem because it was trying to be a serious movie. I am fine with a little bit of jokes in fact that's what every movie needs but this one had way to many and every time there was a serious or sad character moment it would turn it into a joke, so I just wasn't able to take the movie seriously and after a while I just got tired of listening to all of these cheap jokes. Over all it is OK but it has too many flaws to say that it is good.   6/10",-1
one of the most boring MCU movies to date. so many loop holes & unnecessary stale comedy that fell flat. the battle scene all 5 minutes of it in a freaking 3hr movie lmao pathetic!,-1
"Worst Avengers movie ever - Capt Marvel does nothing. Why the hype to release her origin story two months before? Seriously, build up a sequence of 21 films for this terrible end movie????",-1
Infinity wars was so much better. This was not a bad movie but also not good either. The action parts are pretty cool but otherwise it was a long boring movie,-1
"The only plus to this movie, and the only reason for score 1 in stead of 0 is ... no, it is 0. The makers of this movie have failed miserably. It is difficult to make such a movie work, with so many characters, but they get an F nonetheless. They could have done a much better job. Let me repeat one thing about superhero movies. They are inherently dumb. The whole premise is just dumb - people with superpowers. But it's a wonderful fantasy - people with superpowers. That's why the creators must put in extra effort to mitigate the dumbness by making the best possible story. Some superhero movies do a better job at that than others. This one does not, and I rank it really low, along with 'Thor - The Dark World' and 'Batman - The Dark Knight Rises'. I shall only mention two things out of many, that make this movie so awful: Thor and Feminism. Let me address both. Thor, one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics and the great Dignitary, has generally been portrayed terribly in the movies - all of them, with the possible exception of Infinity War. First, he's been bland and a spoiled brat in Thor - part one, then he's a stupid, uninteresting oaf through a couple of movies, and then they start introducing clownish aspects to this character, which culminates catastrophically in this movie with fat, drunk, whiny, bum Thor. It is unforgivable. To make things even worse, they don't even let him get in a single blow against Thanos in the final battle. He just gets brutalized by Thanos, and Captain America basically takes over his supposed role, and battles Thanos properly. In the end, they put him with the Guardians of Galaxy. Since they are a bunch of clowns, he's should fit right in, but another problem there is that Chris Hemsworth is simply not funny. Maybe he could have been very good for the role of Thor, had they written the character properly, but he's no comedian, however hard he may try. I guess some people thought that he was very funny being shocked and zapped, he was not.As for the feminism: I like feminism. I also like a good sandwich, but if you shove it violently down my throat, I am going to hate that particular sandwich, and I'm going to hate you. I am talking about that scene during the final battle when ONLY female characters come together to support Captain Marvel in whatever she was trying to do, I don't care. If you desperately want to push societal issues in what is basically a lowbrow superhero movie, you should nonetheless try to make it less painfully obvious and stupid.MCU finale is a total fail. I watched it, many people watched it, you'll watch it, but it is bad.",-1
"This movie was a huge disappointment. A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel about which I can talk for hours. I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is. And it seems like it is working.",-1
Fun film but massively overrated. The final battle was a tedious cycle of cliches with nothing but good cgi to back it up and there was no shortage of plot holes and conveniences.,-1
"It was just Okay. Certainly entertaining but not anywhere as good as Infinity War. There are some good notes. Some great dialogue and action-sequences. The overall plot is pretty solid. Buuuuuuuut, the pacing is sluggish and choppy. After the first hour, I found myself wondering when the movie would actually start. I got bored. I've never gotten bored watching an MCU movie before! Some of the character design choices were not well-explained or executed. You are made to accept that 'These well-established character(s) are suddenly different and like this now'. I guess the writers thought the events from the prior movie would be good enough but I think that is lazy and insufficient. I'm glad I saw it but I don't think I will feel inclined to watch it ever again.",-1
"It was pretty good, then it got pretty bad, then it got good again, and then a little bit much... overall decent...",-1
"Just dreadful. Almost all of this entire 3+ hour snoozefest was nothing but a weepy gaze backward at the most bloated commercial cash-extraction machine in cinematic history.

"A lot of plot holes, Captain Marvel with the speed above light to bring Iron Man back, Nebula bringing all Thanos' troop without even a **** Pym Particle.In the previous installment Thor almost killed Thanos equiped with the 6 gems, now he gets kicked in the ass by a Gemless Thanos just because he got fat? (WTF IS THAT?)TerribleGet better MCU.",-1

Even then I almost walked out on this one...The move is 2/3 of the cast feeling sorry for themselves and the last 1/3 is them actualy doing something about it... There, that's the movie. Was a waste of my time and money...",-1
I was there at the beginning as Iron Man took flight for the fist time. I was there for the first Avengers I was there for Infinity War and everything in between. But the ending felt... hollow. It was funny it was even emotional but something was... off. It did not work. There was some forced stuff I will not get into and a ton of things that did not make any sense. The ending of the movie is a set up for things to come but it feels eerily similar to what happened in the comics industry. Good characters got destroyed and mediocrity took over in the name of misguided agendas.You can judge it best for yourself but I can't help but feel as if they could have done a lot better.,-1
The movie is based on nonsense. I believe if one superhero can save the world then 10 of them would easily destroy thanos. So it's so stupid that these superheroes can't kill thanos. And where was captain marvel in avengers infinity war? did she have anything more important than saving the universe to do?,-1
"Way, way, waaaaaay, way, way too long. Nothing else is even worth mentioning because it's 3 times longer than it should be.",-1
"In short not as good as infinity war.Cons:There is a bit of the new disney ""SJW"" signalling going on this this movie, one scene in particular beats you over the head with ""Woman power"" completely taking you out of the moment.Scenes that should naturaly of been sad or epic were massivly overwrought to the extent that they were basicly telling you what you should be feeling, rather than generating the emotion itself.The ""big"" action scene was hugely overdone, way too many charatcers for one scene which left it feeling like a Transformers battle where you cant quite tell whats happening.The third act was substantialy worse than the first two.The storyline was laughable compared to infinity war, with fairly massive plot holes and logic leaps.Thanos lost everything that made him an interesting villain.Pros:Some good use of comedy in the first and second actSome of the visuals were very goodSome memorable scenes, especialy during the ""dopelganger"" scenes.Good time travelling mechanics.Suprising movie opening.Overall its a definite watch if your a fan of the series, just dont get your expectations up to high as this wouldnt even rank in my top 5 Marvel films.",-1
"Endgame is a mess. The only positive things that I have to say is the character development, I only like the the character development because of the fact about how many people they have to remember. Now the negative stuff. Let's start off with thor, Thor was so poorly written when he didnt kill thanks who should've been more to determined to fight back instead of being that fat slob we got to know, He should have been motivated to fight back. Black widow. Here is a bit more respect to marvel most of the time I think black widow is wasted but in endgame she had a decent role before she died. Professor hulk,  professor hulk was a nerdy mess the cgi at some points almost made me puke. The pacing was okay, but now the big daddy the plot holes. The plot holes were almost as bad as the ones in captain Marvel here are some I found in the first 30 minutes. Endgame Plot Holes why would fury still be holding on to that pager after 20 yearsHow did the avengers find the pager and bring it back to the compoundPeter quill ship does have a transponder the avengers would recognizeAlso captain marvel doesn't have anything to track a signalWhen a ship runs out of fuel it doesn't just stop it keeps its momentum and keeps going and eventually slows downHow does captain marvel talk and breath in space and survive the vacuum without imploding but in captain marvel she needed a helmetHow did she bring iron man and nebula down to earthNebula when she gets back says she knows thanos s whereabouts but her and Tony have been on the spaceship for weeks and tony told steve he knows nothing Conclusion endgame got a solid 5.",-1

"Considering how much I enjoyed Infinity War, I was surprised by how disappointing Endgame was.  Not a bad movie by far, and some of the things that bothered me won't be an issue for others, but I expected more.  With that said, the beginning and ending are the best parts, so you'll likely leave the theatre happy (even if the movie doesn't sit too well as you digest it).I was surprised by the amount of humor.  And even though I thought the jokes mostly landed, it was weird that in a universe where half of sentient life disappeared there are so many people cracking jokes.  I would have appreciated a darker humor until the snap is reversed.  I just felt it undercut the stakes and loss the characters would be feeling after their defeat in the last movie, even if a bit of levity is needed for the audience's sake.The thing that bothered me the most was the reliance of time travel as a plot device.  I can accept time travel if it's just kind of in the background, but the moment a movie tries to make it seem real is the moment I can't accept it anymore.  The worst part of Endgame is that despite telling myself several times, ""Just ignore it and have fun!"" the movie spends a lot of screen time on the time travel plot and is constantly trying to justify it.  In the end I couldn't get past it and it made the middle of the movie really sag.",-1
Good special effects. Pretty much everything else sucked almost beyond imagination.,-1
"Though Avengers: Endgame is filled to the brim with heart felt moments, the logically mess cannot be ignored. The editing, pacing, and writing are a giant mess and no matter how many awesome visuals or big moments occur on screen, these major issues cannot simply be ignored. The Russos have finally made a mediocre at best film and I would not be surprised if studio interference was a part of it. You can subjectively love this movie, but you cannot simply ignore the plethora of narrative and character issues that are strewn throughout this 3 hour mess. C-",-1

"PROS: stunning visuals and animations; good music; compelling interactions between the main characters that have stayed since The Avengers (2012); satisfying resolution to the 11 year long ""Infinity Saga"" story arc.CONS: it takes itself too seriously for a fantasy story with super-powered characters dressed in costumes; overlong and overcrowded 3-hour space-time action-adventure that lacks creativity; excessive use of CGI in detriment of real acting.",-1
"After the mind-blowingly stellar and near perfect Avengers: Infinity Wars, I went to see Avengers: EndGame and was severely disappointed. Despite an admirable performance by Robert Downey Jr, the rest of this trainwreck is easily the worst Marvel movie made in years. Horrid pacing and a non-existent script and the most cringe-worthy performance outshine the admittedly fantastic CGI and strong choreography. It goes to show that a movie even with triple AAA CGI and special effects will fall flat on its face without a coherent and strong script. The Hulk is made into an absolute joke in EndGame, and Thanos motivations are little different from the prequel, except worse. Chris Hemsworth's performance as an Alcoholic Thor destroys what little hope was left for this movie. To say Hemsworth's performance was cringe-worthy doesn't do the experience any justice. Outside of Robert Downey Jr, most of the actors felt flat and uninspired in Endgame. Little is different about the plot from Infinity War, except that Infinity War had a dark twist ending and compellingly developed the antagonist as a villain. In Endgame, Thanos just feels like a substandard cliche, ""I want to take over the world"" stereotype. Despite the phenomenal battle scenes and choreography, the robotic and lifeless performance from the rest of the cast, not to mention aggravatingly horrible jokes and cliches riddled throughout the picture destroy all credibility this film could have had. Its as if the film directors and screenwriters looked at all the elements that were prodigious about Infinity War and said to themselves, ""Who needs ANY of that when we can have cliches?""    Avengers: Infinity War is without a doubt the superior film, and Marvel would be wise to revisit its strongest aspects to improve on the sequel.",-1
"Possibly one of the most overrated movies of all time and in my eyes the weakest of the marvel movies produced. All credit from this movie comes from the stunning visual effects and the well crafted score composed by Alan Silvestri, however when the budget is over 350 million dollars, it’s hard for the vfx to look bad. The pacing and tone of the movie was all over the place, and seemed split between going for a lighthearted feel like Guardians Of The Galaxy, or a more serious outlook like Infinty War. The movie was fun yes, but for a decade of build up and being a sequel to the arguably the best mcu movie of all time, Infinity War, the movie fell short in meeting the expections of what I had in mind. They turned my 2 favourite hero's of Hulk and Thor into characters only there for comedic value. A decade of character development just for them to lose all of that in Endgame really ruined the movie in my opinion. The movie suffered from an extreme imbalance between comedy and seriousness, and for that reason I believe it to be the most underwhelming marvel movie of all time.",-1

Just for example:(ultimate sacrafice for the soulstone - Hawkey lost his family already; time travel; Ant-Man rescued by rat; Thor took Mjolnir to his timeline; Nebula did not travel back in time, but stayed on the ship and got caught instead; Thor almost killed Thanos when he had the gauntlet with all stones and could not beat him without it; Tony takes all stones away from Thanos, just like that). There are many more, but those are the major ones.- weak, dull and unnecessary jokes - pace and narration problems. It felt somethimes like there was a struggle betwwen two concepts and both ideas were implemented.- forced and unnecessary ""strong independent women to the rescue with Spiderman"" sceneFor me a Marvel fan it is a huge disappointment, especially after such good Infinity War.

They kept changing the nonsensical time-travel rules to fit whatever the writers wanted to happen next.  There was never any core group of lead characters for the viewer to latch onto and to actually care about.  This unfocused and nonsense ruined any feelings of danger or threat.

"I can't give more than 6 to this film that is nothing compared to Infinity War. 3 hours are too many and the beginning of this film is so slow,here is the reason of the 3 hours. I didn't like Thor at all because for me that's not the real Thor.About Professor Hulk I can say that I wanted more insights of the character which is not well studied.The only part of this film that I liked was the end, the final battle, ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!""",-1
The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed. Overall i am unsatisfied with how Endgame went and i do not agree with the high ratings its been given just for the sake of it.,-1
"Solid Marvel pic but too long.  The movie is definitely fun and a “must see” if you’re even a mild Marvel fan.  Yet, be warned there’s nothing new here and with all the hype I expected more.  The first two thirds of the movie are really slow and the plot feels labored and stale.  The last third of the movie is more interesting - yet, even there, the fights seem totally redundant.  Although I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it, I feel like this movie reinforces the idea that Marvel needs a fresh approach going forward.  Also, I have to comment on the length of the movie, three hours with no intermission just doesn’t work.  At least a third of the viewers in our theater had to get up and take a break during the screening... viewers of all ages by the way... so, I’d like to see either a shorter cut of the movie or an intermission built in...  its very distracting when people are moving in/out of the theater.",-1
"Boring, long and far below expectation after the great movie infinity war. First two hours trying to explain crazy time travel theories. Last hour, with more action, nonsense dialogues, dark battles and low impact after return of heroes previously swept. Didn´t like it.",-1
"I don't get the hype behind the movie. All that happened was that they went back in time and stolen the infinity stones before Thanos got them. Then thanos gets wind of it and travels to their time. Then a big fight happens where there's tons of booms and such. Everyone was playing 'keep away' with the stones. Some people were put on a mantle *coughmostlythefemalescough* while a few people died on screen. Then one hero uses the stones to 'snap' away all of thanos's troops, this guy dies and everyone gets sad over it. There's some narration by the dead dude and all other heroes continue on their day to day activities. That was the whole movie sum'ed up and honestly? This whole movie just felt really cliche'd and average at best. I wasn't that invested in anything and I actually grown bored with all the drama and sob stories that was constantly occurring. The action scenes were too flashy and just all over the place and while there was some unexplained plotholes in the film and even a large amount of dangling threads, I honestly think they're just planning on explaining those things in a future film or something. Regardless, not worth seeing unless you are heavily invested in the Marvel franchise you might like the movie but as for me, a person not invested heavily in the Marvel Franchise?  I thought it was just and average cliched film at best.",-1
"While it's a definite improvement over its snoozy predecessor, this latest installment in the franchise gets some things right but misses the mark on others. It's refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't place an overreliance on special effects and action sequences, choosing (wisely) to take a more human and personal approach to telling its story. It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid). Die-hard fans will no doubt love this, but, to the less initiated, this is likely to come across as a somewhat half-baked effort.",-1
"Definitely not as interesting as Infinity War.  And while I like long movies, I only like them if I like them, and this was long and boring.  It was ""okay.""  Anti-climactic at best.  Oh well.",-1
It is unfortunately but not unexpected that they would drop the ball at the end. There are simply too many characters and the story is quite boring and messed up.,-1
"Fell flat. Started high but slowly declined into boredom. Certainly the plot and characters are all subversive, but so is eating what you think is a chocolate chip cookie and finding raisins instead.",-1
"Boring, trunkated characters, plotholes, stupid story, badly managed drama. Way to long... All events are predicted from A:IF easily, no surprises. Worst possible ending of the saga. Goodby my dreams of an epic conclusion. And a last question... How can universe can still exist if the one that make it like this disapear before doing it ? Storytelling noobs... Stop ruining my childhood superheroes...",-1
"Yeah, I hoped for a good film, but this was nowhere near one…As it stands the first part of this duology is a much stronger film. So Infinity War > Endgame. By a huge margin, I would add…SPOILERS AHEADEndgame was rather disappointing and slow, the pacing was awful, and it just sort of fizzed out by the end of it, not even the death of Iron-Man felt special. His previous fight with Thanos on Titan felt more impactful. And that’s just it… The film rang hollow as a whole. It just did not flow as easily as Infinity War, and was lost in its time travel shenanigans… Spider-Mans and Peppers goodbyes felt like ticks on squares. Its like the rollercoaster ride was a flat line that didn’t take the highs to where they should have soared and as a result it meandered through long stretches of melancholy emotions and dialogues, many of which could have been cut shorter. They lost on film, on action, to honour characters, parents, loss, grief, friendship... I get that, but it’s a lot and too much at times, so they lost the dynamics of film in the process. The films story-telling suffered. Its depressive opening tone was soon undercut by its trademark one-liners and quips, and it soon felt like the whole film was straying in a strange direction where the filmmakers couldn’t decide which way to go and how they wanted to paint the film as it were. The way they went with many of its characters and their moments felt like they were not holding up or were just jarring. Some of these are…What have they done to Thor? It feels like they ran out of creativity so they lazily shat on his character and made him a **** and a loser. Also, Thor somehow beats Thanos with a fully gemmed glove with Stormbreaker, but can’t do so with Mjolnir and Stormbreaker against Thanos without any gems? Where is the consistency? Also, if he takes Mjolnir from another timeline than what does Thor fight with in that timeline, in the Dark World and Ragnarok?What have they done to Hulk?  We don’t get any action from the Big Green. Its especially disappointing after he was held back in Infinity War. So there is no payoff for Hulk? Really? They fumbled his character where he should have unleashed the monster and overcome his fear of Thanos. Big mistake character wise. They left him unused. One-armed and weak. Shame, it still feels like such a huge and glaring missed opportunity.Also, the whole soulstone bit with Widow and Hawkeye just feels like a cheap gimmick after the drama with Thanos and Gamora in the previous film. Hawkeye is mourning the love of his life, his family, so the Russos make him ultimately sacrifice himself for a collegue from office? Cause that’s how their relationship always felt. Isn’t getting the soulstone about the ultimate sacrifice one makes? Why didn’t Banner go with Natasha? It would have made more sense soulstone story wise? Hell, Cap had more chemistry with the Black Widow than Hawkeye… Odd choices.There are many other missteps (a friggin rat?), but in conclusion: Nothing remarkable happens for the first two hours (for an action spectacle film, spectacular action is nowhere to be seen) and the third act or hour feels overstuffed and incomprehensible, with dialogues and action all over the place. Where Infinity War was good at balancing characters, acts and plotlines, Endgame is nowhere near as coherent. The last act feels like too much of everything, and very little of it is quality. Honestly, Endgame does not FEEL like a magical blockbuster experience after you exit the theatre, nor does it deserve a higher grade than a 5/10.",-1
"You sit there waiting for it to start well after the movie begins, shaking your head in disbelief as this unbelievably thin, abominably bad bloated bore ticks on and on!  The same creatives have delivered the same padded plodding overlong junk one entry after another.Once upon a time, superhero movies were made by adults for wide general audiences.  Now they're made by childish nerds for the dumb illiterate global masses who eat up whatever **** Hollywood shovels out!  Marvel, once dramatically clever and incredibly inventive, now puts out uneven unfunny goofy geek comedies.It used to be serious actors balked at comic book fare.  Now they can't take it seriously enough.  The annoying cast in this ridiculous over-the-top series never question the utter lack of narrative talent of its writers, directors and producers, but instead dutifully drone on yucking it up on talk shows and all the way to the bank.  Where's the oversight?!  Disney/Marvel and the rest don't care or know how to make good movies anymore.  They're bean counters on an auto pilot conveyor belt.  There's no restraint whatsoever regarding plausibility.  As absurd as the original grouping of superheroes is (but fun and true to the source, not invalid), they go and pile on every Marvel property including large groupings not even part of The Avengers into a smorgasbord of so many freaking characters slapped together in an endless stupid stream of one liners as excuse for story the result is incoherent plotting (despite its infantile simplicity) and really no emotional investment in any of the characters at all.However big the inflation/population driven box office, this is some very underwhelming STUPID ****",-1
"Had to check my watch during the first 2 hours, not because of a lack of action, heck, most of my favorite movies have zero or near zero action in them, but because it was just a yawn inducing cringing fest. And the last hour was just as cringy.I'm done with the Marvel/Superheros ""grandiose"" movies I guess. Only Marvel movies I'll watch going forward will probably be the Doctor Strange ones.",-1
"Completely impossible to follow plot line, sound level fluctuations in the movie made it horrible to sit through.",-1
"History repeats itselfJennifer Aniston and Martin Scorsese should have thought twice before commenting on Marvel movies just after Stan Lee's death. Why not do it while he was still alive? Stan Lee had invested all his energy and love to defend the characters he created, hoping that one day, they could be presented on the big screen. He had spent most of his life trying to achieve this. If he were still alive, Stan Lee would have immediately reacted and shamed those two people. I am not talking about those two marvelous creators but of the individuals they are. One must always distinguish the creations of an artist from the person the creator actually is. One may like Woody Allen movies without having to like the person. In literature, I love Journey to the End of the Night but dislike and resent the pro-fascist, antisemitic author, Louis-Ferdinand Céline.For those not aware of Martin Scorsese and Jennifer Aniston’s comments:Martin Scorsese said: “Marvel movies are not Cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them (the MCU films), as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.”Jennifer Aniston thinks Marvel is ‘ruining cinema.’In the mid-50s and especially in the early 1960s, rock has burst onto the music scene with singers such as Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, and bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Doors, which were soon followed by Santana, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, to name a few. Classical music lovers treated this new musical trend with disdain and contempt and considered it by no means to be music. Shortly after, this so-called ""noise"" pushed aside classical music and invaded the media.Today, again, history is repeating itself.Thanks to special effects, a new genre of films has taken cinemas by storm. In terms of audience and revenue, the MCU surpasses anything that has been done before. If these films are what the public wants to see, is that not all that matters?Martin Scorsese has written, directed, and produced masterpieces - The Departed, Gangs of New York, Casino, GoodFellas, The Aviator, Shutter Island... Jennifer Aniston was a wonderful woman in Marley and Me, Derailed, The Good Girl, and, for 10 years, the lovely Rachel Green, in Friends. In their own particular fashion, both were game-changers.How can a genius such as Martin Scorsese not understand that something new and unexpected like the MCU can be a game-changer? The MCU will keep on attracting viewers until either another technological revolution brings us completely different films, impossible to imagine today, or the MCU will run out of ideas, or viewers will get tired of this kind of movies just as viewers got tired of other genres which have completely disappeared, such as the Western whose audience appears to be drying up... The MCU won’t be on the forefront forever.",-1
"Very Dissatisfied!Written April 26, 2019I don't understand why they felt the need to teardown the characters from our childhood in an effort to make others stand out. It's truly sad to think that the ""feminist"" aspect of this film doesn't believe enough in their own power to stand WITH their male counterparts without first changing the ""strongest"" characters at their core. There were so many times they tried to deliver humor that was strained, and too many plot holes for a 3 hour film. Finish with an ending that truly disappointed my kid. My 12 year old says he's now a DC fan!",-1
"First half of the movie was mawkish like some soap opera. From what i understood, only half of the living beeings was anihilated, so why in this movie, Earth looks deserted, like it was ninety percent? The rest of the movie was just meh.  There were some good emotional moments, but most just made me roll my eyes. All in all i didn't enjoy most of the movie - probably becouse i got so tired with it's first 1,5h. Liked the ending.",-1
This movie was okay. I am in love with thor because hes super awesome and sexy and captain america sucks i hate him hes so annoying. I was very disappointed with this movie because thor was fat and not sexy for almost the entire movie he barely fought. I almost cried when that idiot captain america was able to pick up thors hammer but i was even more mad when his eyes turned blue and he could do the lightning thing. Thor is way more awesome than captain america and in avengers end game it didnt seem like it. It was more of a comedy than an action and adventure movie. The ending was sad because my third favourite avenger iron man died I rly rly rly wish that it was captain america instead. But anyways thor is just super awesome and it would have been fine if he was fat for a bit then he was sexy and awesome again at the end for the fight scene but no he was fat and not awesome the entire time. I was super excited to see thor be all awesome and his eyes turn blue and lightning strikes everywhere like when he came into wakanda in infinity war but nooooo he was fat and not sexy. And also i didnt like captain marvels haircut and the first 2 hours of the movie suck and i wish that they at least made all the superheros awesome for the end. But instead they made everyone but the strongest avenger (thor) awesome. And i also like black panther and he was in it for like two seconds and i love tom holland and he was cute in it but he was only in it for like two seconds. So pretty much thor rules captain america drools but for some reason they made thor fat and not awesome at fighting and not sexy the whole movie so im very upset but obviously i still love thor with all my heart chris hemsworth is the sexiest man alive,-1
I was there at the beginning as Iron Man took flight for the fist time. I was there for the first Avengers I was there for Infinity War and everything in between. But the ending felt... hollow. It was funny it was even emotional but something was... off. It did not work. There was some forced stuff I will not get into and a ton of things that did not make any sense. The ending of the movie is a set up for things to come but it feels eerily similar to what happened in the comics industry. Good characters got destroyed and mediocrity took over in the name of misguided agendas.You can judge it best for yourself but I can't help but feel as if they could have done a lot better.,-1
The previous one was much better this one is just a fan service. Iron man acting was disappointing I found myself laughing on his death scene. Thanos didn't make sense like the previous avengers...they made him the tpyical bad guy kiLl AlL pEOPlE...,-1
"Disappointing. Movie ruined all the original characters, and 3 hours was not necessary (and don't bother sitting through the end credits to hear an audio clip).Black Widow was a bad-ass in all the movies,yet, they made her character teary-eyed and overly emotional in almost every scene. and she had no real fight scenes? What? And she wasn't even given a decent death scene, just drop to your death.Captain America - giving up the shield so easily, it's like a slap in our face that he regretted being Cap America -- and wait, how was he able to stay in the past. That would mean there were 2 Steve Rogers in that timeline. And why couldn't he tell Falcon, who's he married to. Duh, we ALL know. And what?? He was able to get Thor's hammer. NO way.Thor - another character, he was bad-ass in all other movies, then reduced in this movie as drunk, emotional idiot and renounced his ""throne"" because he's not a Leader. What?Hulk - he's suppose to be a genius too but this time he couldn't figure out Quantum Physics. But Scott Lang had the idea? AH?? What???Clint - all of sudden a murderer (of criminals) and he was able to take down cartels on his own? hmmm.. really?Fury and Hill - were reduced to cameo appearances.. UGH. Horrible.The only character that stayed true was Tony Stark. His actions and dialogue made sense, and his death made sense too. This was suppose to be a comic book movie, not a bad soap opera or scifi movie.",-1
"The storyline was eh, the action seemed rehashed from other Avenger movies, several hidden agendas, the time travel thing didn't fully make sense, characters were overpowered at times, things just didn't add up, overall disappointing and doesn't live up to the quality of the other Avenger movies.",-1
For a movie full of plotholes and inconsistencies I feel like it has been doing well in reviews and box office. A movie with great and epic superhero moments but at the end it's just that: another superhero movie.,-1
"Considering how much I enjoyed Infinity War, I was surprised by how disappointing Endgame was.  Not a bad movie by far, and some of the things that bothered me won't be an issue for others, but I expected more.  With that said, the beginning and ending are the best parts, so you'll likely leave the theatre happy (even if the movie doesn't sit too well as you digest it).I was surprised by the amount of humor.  And even though I thought the jokes mostly landed, it was weird that in a universe where half of sentient life disappeared there are so many people cracking jokes.  I would have appreciated a darker humor until the snap is reversed.  I just felt it undercut the stakes and loss the characters would be feeling after their defeat in the last movie, even if a bit of levity is needed for the audience's sake.The thing that bothered me the most was the reliance of time travel as a plot device.  I can accept time travel if it's just kind of in the background, but the moment a movie tries to make it seem real is the moment I can't accept it anymore.  The worst part of Endgame is that despite telling myself several times, ""Just ignore it and have fun!"" the movie spends a lot of screen time on the time travel plot and is constantly trying to justify it.  In the end I couldn't get past it and it made the middle of the movie really sag.",-1

this was disappointing after the epic infinity war. they butchered thor and hulk's character,-1
"The movie is pretty bad. The time travel mechanics make no sense, the choreography of the end fight doesn't make sense, it lacks any sense of geography (even Michael Bay fights have some), this is specially disssapointing because the Russo Brothers previous film did had some. In contrast this is an overcrowded mess, that is impossible to follow, I hate CGI generic debris, you can tell they were just hitting the air at a green screen. The main villian is such dissapointment from the previous film, such a downgrade, Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 comes to mind. For all the cameos, not a single contributes to anything, you could remove some and the plot would be the same,the dialogue is mostly interchangable among most characters too. Worse part is the conflict that made the heroes lose on the previous film, as well as the Pseudo-Civil War where nobody died), is resolved off-screen. Nobody learns anything they just win by facing the equivalent of a Baby version, that's cheating.Then everyone knows you shouldn't alter the past,.nor create alternate dimensions for selfish reasons. What this hero does, it makes Rick & Morty's Rick Sanchez look like a decent person. Is creepy. And resurectimg characters is always bad",-1
"First of all, let me state the fact that whoever embraces time travel in movie/TV/video game plots, needs to up his standards. It is one of the laziest and most uninspiring attempts to create stories around and usually ends up in not making any sense (just like in this movie).As for the film itself, it started great by showing everyone's pain and anger towards Thanos, but from the moment that mouse(lol) happens to press a button and create this whole ""time travel"" plot, everything goes to absolute **** And it's not just the time traveling, it's also the disrespect shown to characters like The Hulk and Thor, as well as the Shonen anime type of ass pulls like Captain America fighting with Thor's hammer and summoning lightnings from the sky. Moving on to Thanos.. He was there, but he wasn't really. The villain that Infinity War built is not there and even worse, he goes out of character claiming to destroy the Universe and how he will enjoy torturing Earth. Last but not least, the typical feministic cringy bull****.. Captain Marvel has the gauntless and the only ones running to protect her are the female Avengers? All my **** lolz at that scene.This movie took a huge **** on what Infinity War had built and scrapped everything that made it great. Sadly, we live in an age where people have low standards and get manipulated by heavy marketing so I expect this movie to be considered a ""success"".",-1
"I was definitely disappointed with this after watching Infinity War. Thanos who was a great, very well developed villain was turned into another bland emotionless sludge. The forced girl power narratives were also an eye roll. Fat Thor was ridiculous, coupled with all of the sob stories. However there were definitely redeeming qualities about this movie. They explained the time travel very well and somewhow out of all the characters I thought Hawkeye was the best.",-1

"This is the absolute worst marvel movie I have ever seen. I thought I was angry about the ""strong independent women don't need no man"" forcing. I thought I was angry about the inconsistencies. I am angry about the end of the movie, when Tony was at his weakest, barely managing to stay alive. Tony's wife indirectly killed him by telling them to give up and die. They had a chance of staying alive, you don't just tell someone they can die when they're barely conscious. Especially if it's someone their semi-consciously responding to. What actually happens when you tell someone that; They're a loved one and telling to die?; Must be better to die then. The absolute nerve and the ignorance. I don't even know how to describe this other than a massive betrayal from the character that doesn't even know they were the final nail in the coffin. I was personally insulted when they told him that, and a bit more when they cried after killing them. I would rate lower if I could.",-1

"Infinity War was a wonderful epic film yet this doesn't feel like it is written or directed by the same people.They 'cleansed' Thor and Hulk of their toxic masculinity making them literally laughing stocks. From IW when Thor had an amazing journey, he is just embarrassing in this. And Hulk whose MO is losing his **** and smashing things up is suddenly all touchy feely - what the hell. It's almost like there is some kind of agenda in needing to clip the wings of the old guard before the next phase.The time travel feels silly and gimmicky and nothing more than self indulgent fan service. They effectively ape IW by having the Avengers go on a stone search just like Thanos did in IW. It makes scenes such as that on Vormire have little or no tension because we saw it all in the other film.Tony and Steve's arc doesn't get any decent closure with Tony reverting to the self absorbed douche bag that he was when the series started and Steve being his effective verbal whipping boy. All the efforts to make Thanos engaging and empathetic are cast aside so that the journey we saw him go on in IW is just thrown in the trash and we are given the 2014 Thanos who is just a cardboard cut out evil bad guy. This isn't the guy that we saw in IW who made the sacrifice on Vormire and could empathise with Scarlet Witch.For no reason whatsoever, he has decided against his life goal of a 50% cull of the universe to complete annihilation of everything even though he hasn't had the opportunity to experience the 'fruits' of his cull. He is also now ridiculously over powered. In IW, Stormbreaker nearly kills Thanos when he has all six stones yet in Endgame, he has no stones or gauntlet and Thor can't mortally damage him with Stormbreaker AND Mjolnir.I've seen many try to dismiss these as easily explainable plot holes but the reality is that they are just lazy writing and pretentious directing. Seemingly the makers got themselves into a hole with a fearsome yet sympathetic bad guy, cooked up a time travel device that created nothing but a slew of contradictions, removed the straight line linearity of IW, invested all the money in a final battle that looked like an over inflated DC mess rather than matching the clear and beautifully simple fights/battles from IW and felt the need to hobble some of the biggest characters to signal their social justice virtue.This disappointment of a film which must rank as the Russo's worst MCU film smacks of what happened with Joss Whedon and the Ultron film. Too much pressure and studio meddling , straight jacketed by a dose of political correctness and a loss of stand out creativity to be patched over with fan pleasing guff.Given the Russo's previous stellar work, I expected this to be sure fire hit but what I got was a hot mess of a film that tried to tie things up but rendered itself a little vanilla in doing so. What a wasted opportunity , what a sad end to what had been a glorious 10 years and what a disappointing follow on from the fabulous Infinity War.",-1
"Drab, predictable, boring. This movie was dragged out too long to make sure all of its stars had screen time and that made it unbearable to watch.",-1
"Unlike its predecessor, the last movie of this tetralogy (so far) becomes a dragging and tiring movie, simply because it is the climax of 22 films that preceded it.The movie is too long (3h01min), has several backstory, not taking advantage of 20% of them, and some characters are poorly developed, such as Rocket and Nebula.But not everything is lost. The script works very well the ending of the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johanson) and the other avengers such as Thor, Hawkeye and Hulk are left as supporting, but that add something to the story.Avengers: Endgame, tries to imitate the formula of its predecessor (Infinity War - 2018), but fails to deliver a cohesive script, leaving a bitter taste in the viewer's mouth.",-1

"Boring, predictable, not intense, wanted to sleep many times during this unnecessary 3 hours of lame dialogs.Feminism is a crucial part of Hollywood, so of course there are some scenes just about that, it isn't so bad. BUT! Captain Marvel ruins any common sense and conflict in story, if there were no other characters the final wouldn't really change, because there is nothing that she couldn't do just by herself. There cannot be any good story in the universe where 1 character could potentially solve all the problems, but this character doesn't do it for no reason whatsoever.",-1
Writing left much to be desired. They really milked the nostalgia. Predictable plot,-1
"Endgame was a major disappointment. Long overly drawn out tear jerking scenes mixed up with weak humor, plot holes and too few fight scenes plagued with very inconsistent power levels.Not to speak of what they did to many of the characters which can hardly be recognized (this goes beyond a certain Asgardian).Despite the overly long running time the movie fails to give many important characters sufficient screen time. The plot is extremely thin and telegraphed providing little tension or suspense except the in last 20 minutes.TL;DR Endgame is too long a movie trying to mix drama and superhero humor, with poor results. This movie can't hold a candle to its predecessor infinity wars.",-1
"I had wowed never again to watch another movie with the hideously lazy Robert Downey Jr in it. I had wowed even more to never again watch another movie containing the even more lazy and awful Chris Pratt. Ditto for the abysmal Chris Evans, whose only job is to be ""handsome"". Ruffalo, Johanson, Hemsworth, Cumberbatch; this movie must contain all the laziest actors in the world. Well, Jeff Goldblum isn't in it, so I guess that's one positive. They even managed to either dig up Robert Redford, or reanimate him with computer graphics, to do yet another non-role, exactly as pointless and lame as his last twenty roles were.But above all I had wowed to not waste any more money on the Marvel garbage that they keep churning out, and which people seem to like for some inexplicable reason. So why did I find myself in the movie theater watching this absurdly dumb and tedious movie? Because I'm a moron. What other explanation can there be?If you can survive the bad actors and their incessant oneliners; of two general types: ""clever"" oneliners and ""funny"" oneliners, all the ""dialog"" this movie contains; the actual movie isn't so much a narrative as it is a collection of gags, drowned in special effects. The characters are nonexistent. There is sexy and ""funny"", big and ""funny"", green and ""funny"", young and ""funny"", and about 30 different variations of have breasts and ""funny"". Those last ones also have to prove that they are braver and better than the ones without breasts, as well as ""funny"". Because the movie wasn't boring enough, so we decided to lecture people about ""feminism"" again too. And these are all the characters the movie contains, and all reciting bad oneliners the entire movie long. I wanted to get up and leave after five minutes, yet did not. Moron, see?Other than that it is identical to the last boring Avengers movie, which I was smart enough to download for free and play in the background while doing something far more interesting with my time. They have simply imported Back to the Future and overlaid it on this movie. Hey, if the peasants will watch anything we vomit out, why not. right? The entire torment of a movie is a self-referential stew of all the reasons I hate Hollywood. And now I also hate Marvel.My favorite scene was easily the ""funeral"" of Tony Stark, the just ""funny"" character, obnoxiously played by Downing. The camera panned slowly through the crowd, and I had absolutely no idea who most of the characters were, but was clearly supposed to. Monica Geller's boyfriend from Friends even made an appearance for some reason, although that was never explained. Perhaps Friends was taking place in the Marvel ""universe"" all along. It was somewhere between pathetic and funny. I couldn't decide.And of course, violins for when we're supposed to feel sad, cellos for when we're supposed to feel even sadder, horns for when we're supposed to get excited, clarinets for when we're supposed to think something was funny and all the other cliches of Hollywood brainwashing they could come up with. So it's not just bad; it aggressively insults you. I am starting to think that they really do have some machine somewhere making these movies. I can't think of any other explanation. Humans could not make something this utterly soulless, could they? This movie is so insultingly bad on every single level that I cannot believe people actually like it. Are they putting stuff in the drinking water again? I have to ask...",-1

"Avengers: Endgame was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. While I felt it was step up from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame still disappointed me on an entertainment level. I understand that it’s really hard to live up to the massive hype and satisfy fans with a pre-written storyline, but the slow pacing of Endgame was really frustrating at times. It felt like separate movies playing out at different times, fitted into one movie. The entire first two hours didn’t really give me any surprises, although I was still entertained at times. However, the final battle in the last third of the movie was incredible and the storyline started to draw me in until the final scene. All in all, Endgame was a letdown for me, but I was still entertained for a minor part of the film. (56/100)",-1
"I was somewhat disappointed with Endgame. Following on from the epic that was Infinity war; which coupled action sequences with emotive dramatic scenes, the time-travel arcs in Endgame were peppered with too much slapstick-esque comedy and a lot of unnecessary fan service scenes.",-1

Was there an option that I missed at the ticket kiosk to see either the drool-cup version or stink-bomb version?  Because I sure didn't see the same film.Avoid Endgame unless you get to see it for free.  And even then, the 3 hours of your life is wasted; or maybe watch it in the background while you're doing your taxes, clipping your toenails, etc.Oh, and Brie?  Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich. If it's a good sandwich, you'll get a Diversity Cookie.",-1
"This is a hard review to write.  On the one hand Endgame has a number of exciting and unexpected scenes.  But I have never in my life been more disappointed with a movie.  First it's a full hour too long.  Lots of slow pacing trying to establish relationships that either were or should have been established 5 movies ago.  But the real problem with the film is it's inability to get you to suspend your disbelief.  Speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy are anchored on a single idea.  There may be something fantastic, but it's internally consistent.  If I have a magic broom that lets me fly, it can't suddenly in the middle of story develop the ability to make pop tarts.  If it does, anything becomes possible and the story has no point.  Endgame is riddled with internal inconsistencies.  Because of that, suspending my disbelief became impossible.  Good acting, good special effects and a really poor script.",-1
First of all the story is really boring. There are many scenes where u fallasleep. Also ironman and nebula rescue part is so weird and too fast and not explained well like they were in a hurry to make a short scene that they have been saved by Cpt Marvel. Really badly designed scene. Also no view about the civillians how they feel about their lost friends or families. Nothing we get only view from the avengers and only Earth. Another thing is that where Scott comes out from the quantum realm becuz this scene so fast and really not explained in any way. I know its a 3 hours long movie but sometimes if u cut the boring parts and replace with important part them everything will be okay. So the time travelling is a thing in many movies to fix a movie becuz the directors stupid to make a good movie. Now they split up to 3 groups to get the stones from the past but the biggest joke is they didnt try to get all from one time like before thanos snap. Thanos against thor surprise is really strong becuz he can kill Thanos. Why not travel back cut his arm and take the stones go back and thats all. But they choose the worst part to get the stones from the wrpng and complicated way. Also Thanos wasnt that great villain and the story badly explained about him the comics were way mich better than this idea. They used the bad time travel idea to kill Romanov. Also they use the stones in the end to kill tony stark. When Captain Marvel get the stones and able to snap and kill the villain but not she has a too stupid character. Also this movie killed 3 main characters to give it to the next generation and Captain Marvel character was so bad before and she will ruin the MCU and the others not enough good. Sorry Marvel thats not enough to be worthy like the comics. We got some villains and needed to kill 3 characters read the comics and checkout how many villains are there. Many acting were so bad sometimes they are forced ina scene to be there but totally not exist there.,-1
"Too long and too full of plot holes.  This movie went on and on and did not do anything justice.  Nothing makes sense unless you are a die hard fan that wants fan service.  I was psyched about this movie and totally disappointed.  I do not remember being this disappointed with a Marvel movie in the last 10 years, but this was just bad.  I would not spend money to watch this move again.  At about 1.5 hours in I was staring at my watch wondering how much more time I had left.  I have never done that in any Marvel movie, especially an Avengers movie.  It made no sense and the timeline did not add up.",-1

With very few exceptions, the interesting character interplay and humor that was present in Infinity Wars was absent in this one. It's frustrating to see this movie getting such great reviews from ""professional"" reviewers. With all the money spent and made with these films, couldn't they hire good writers?",-1

"TL;DR: Avengers: Endgame is a massive extravaganza film with a lot of enjoyable moments, but without soul, purpose, artistic vision, philosophy or literary value. It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming ""products"" by the Disney;Marvel brand.Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU.The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending.-RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable.-As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good.-In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event.The Bad:-Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples.As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose.-Direction:The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see.The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the ""past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos"" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some ""cool"" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem.In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: ""Yibambe""! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters.",-1

This movie was okay. I am in love with thor because hes super awesome and sexy and captain america sucks i hate him hes so annoying. I was very disappointed with this movie because thor was fat and not sexy for almost the entire movie he barely fought. I almost cried when that idiot captain america was able to pick up thors hammer but i was even more mad when his eyes turned blue and he could do the lightning thing. Thor is way more awesome than captain america and in avengers end game it didnt seem like it. It was more of a comedy than an action and adventure movie. The ending was sad because my third favourite avenger iron man died I rly rly rly wish that it was captain america instead. But anyways thor is just super awesome and it would have been fine if he was fat for a bit then he was sexy and awesome again at the end for the fight scene but no he was fat and not awesome the entire time. I was super excited to see thor be all awesome and his eyes turn blue and lightning strikes everywhere like when he came into wakanda in infinity war but nooooo he was fat and not sexy. And also i didnt like captain marvels haircut and the first 2 hours of the movie suck and i wish that they at least made all the superheros awesome for the end. But instead they made everyone but the strongest avenger (thor) awesome. And i also like black panther and he was in it for like two seconds and i love tom holland and he was cute in it but he was only in it for like two seconds. So pretty much thor rules captain america drools but for some reason they made thor fat and not awesome at fighting and not sexy the whole movie so im very upset but obviously i still love thor with all my heart chris hemsworth is the sexiest man alive,-1
"Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies to be a great movie. I have always been a Marvel fan , but this is unreasonable. The time conundrum's not withstanding , I feel , the Hulk and Thor were both pushed aside. Capt. Marvel is way too OP and Capt America wielding the Hammer better than Thor? Tony Stark wielding the Gauntlet that the Hulk couldn't take? Convenience is not a good excuse for poor storytelling. Don't even consider the time element. Nothing more than a money grab by Disney and Marvel. Sadly , the fans will flock and they will feel justified. The most important part of any movie is the story. It seems harder and harder to find a cogent and entertaining movie nowadays. Hundreds of millions of dollars and this is the story they come up with? Again , a fan of Marvel since childhood , I feel betrayed. As a child , I mowed lawns so I could buy my favorite Marvel comics. Hated DC and still not really receptive to their stories or characters. I felt the same way with The Last Jedi. So maybe it's a Disney thing. In summation , this movie is truly disappointing for me. A lifelong Marvel fan , maybe it's time to watch something else.",-1
"Trust me, Disney ruined the future of the Marvel universe. It's fanboys fault!",-1
"In a word ""Boring"". What a waste of time! this movie shows all the superheros in their old fragile state and then they eventually die. Everybody is crying, being sad, depressed and dramatic for almost 3 hours. By no means anybody can tell that this is an action movie.Thor was humiliated beyond any tolerable limits. Marvel has Faded all the actor's powers (HULK,THOR) and killed few(IRON MAN, Captain America, Black widow) and humiliated others (THOR). Its definitely not exciting to see captain america swinging Thor's hammer.When they get back in time to save the world they made the movie worst. This time travel thing is used when movie makers can't form a proper story. Overall, this was the worst Marvel movie ever made. Never watch this director's & writer's movie ever again. I know i won't.",-1

So many characters handling stones that not even the Collector or Celestials would touch!! 4. Enemies in the sequel appear to be much weaker for no reason, but maybe that's my imagination.",-1
"Speaking of Gomorrah, seeing her again was great, but they wasted it. TBH, Nebula was great and the stark contrast in the progression of her character, from her interactions with Tony at the very beginning to her and Gomorrah on Thanos’s ship, was really compelling. However, Gomorrah really disappointed me. She has so much depth and tension in her character and they explored it really well in Infinity War, when Quill tried to kill her, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in this one, she changed her mind about her father REAL quick and OFF SCREEN and was really a throwaway character despite the fact that her death was one of the true deaths of infinity war and one of the most beautifully tragic moments for Thanos and humanized him. If they aren’t going to bring her back and give her a real touching moment, then just give her an Easter egg like with Loki and Thor, which was a great moment and really hit the nostalgia. Which brings me to the biggest plot confusion of the movie, which I was thinking about the entire time - isn’t it really hard for a human to hold an infinity stone? They made a huge **** deal about it in Guardians of the Galaxy, and they talked mad **** about how powerful they were, and yet all 13 of the **** were tossing them around like nothing?Furthermore, giving the Hulk the first snap is a **** disgrace, but I’m biased because I hate the Hulk. Bruce and the Hulk combined, great for him, is an obvious culmination of the entire Hulk storyline as a final resolution to his constant warring over the two halves of him, but he’s not a compelling character, he has no depth and he’s pretty **** useless in battle, but he got the snap and survived because he’s super strong!!!! At that point in the movie I was thinking that the director’s were just like “let’s just give them all something so we can end this **** series and move the **** on”. On an aesthetic note, one thing that I thought was so great about Thor Ragnorak and Infinity War were the great, artistic, and cinematic moments when some big, movie changing **** was happening (Thor’s lightning scene jesus **** But Hulk’s snap was in that white ass, clinically lit room in such a tight shot, and you only know it worked because of **** Hawkeye, whose wife is calling him, who once again I will say I don’t give a singular **** about. It just seemed such a far cry from Thanos’s snap moment, and Iron Man’s final snap which were given the time and artistry that they deserved, considering they were LITERALLY movie changing scenes. Speaking of important, climactic scenes scenes, I feel like Captain Marvel wasn’t wonderfully incorporated. She seems to be a very divisive character, from people hating her standalone movie to the rumors that the cast hated Brie Larson, but honestly, if she could knock Thanos out and give him a fair fight, where was she this whole time? She is literally supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe, and she was on the sidelines for the majority of this movie. I will admit there were great scenes, like any Tony/Peter interaction and Cap finally getting his dance with Peggy. These are things that the fans of the MCU have probably been asking for since forever, and getting these moments was quite satisfying. However, Cap being able to wield Thor’s hammer, which happens in the comics and is quite a popular demand of the Russo brothers, was not well explained. Especially with all the **** that Thor went through, giving up this moment for him was a little bit devastating for a Thor fan, and ultimately made me feel like this movie did him SO **** DIRTY. Obviously that moment has its fans and it was pretty well done cinematically, but if Cap is holding Mjolnir, he has the power of Thor, making Thor pretty extraneous in this movie. Also, when was he deemed worthy (tbh I don’t love Cap and knowing all the **** Thor went through to get Mjolnir back when he wasn’t worthy it feels a little bit quick/rushed/convenient/lazy). I think that they could have left many things out (them listing time travel movies, as funny as that is, was at least 5 minutes of my life I could have gotten back) in favor of spending more time developing our last moments with these original Avengers that have shaped our modern conception of superheroes. I went in with incredibly high expectations, and this movie fell quite short of them, but honestly, it gave a lot of lip service to what the fans wanted, to a point where the movie just felt like funny clips strung together by a flimsy plot line. And it was a funny movie - to a point where every serious or dark or tragic movie was almost immediately undercut with levity. Ultimately I think this movie had to do too much and didn’t have the time or bandwidth to do it all perfectly, and I’ll miss all the original Avengers despite the failings of this movie. [2/2]",-1
"It sucked not majorly, but kinda does in the beginning. The time traveling makes no actual sense and contradicts everything in the movie.

"Utterly pointless movie. Replace the last ten minutes of IW with the last ten minutes of Endgame, and you have everything of note in a single movie. Unfortunately a big step back from Infinity War. IF offered an epic plot with the fantastic worlds, that was made great by great characters. EG is emotional and character-based drama. The only problem is, emotions and characters are where EG fails. It is hard to believe those two movies were made by the same people. Bad script, bad direction, bad pretty much everything. Scenes and emotions flow without any regard to each other, scenes of sadness, abruptly replaced by comical ones. A lot of scenes that serve no particular purpose, other than cheap and stupid jokes in what is supposed to be a tragical/drama movie. Or vain effort to convey emotions or shoehorn something in. A man that is able to build a fusion reactor in a cave has to wait for a space taxi? Or that Hawkey/Widow thing. Why is Hawkeye willing to exchange his whole family for Widow? Survivor guilt, yeah, but other than that, why does he want to jump off that cliff? His haircut?Character-wise, I am of course not talking about Brian ""Deus Ex"" Larson, who is just a bad actress playing a bad character in bad scenes. I mean, it is almost funny, she is so OP they have to figure out how to keep her out of the story, because otherwise she would not only marginalise every other hero, but the whole story as well. So bad.Or Black Widow, cold-blooded killer who for some strange reason had a nervous breakdown and now rules the universe while surviving on peanut butter sandwiches. No jelly, that is how serious it is. And the movie is full of such silly and naive scenes one would expect from a college director. Well, it is about time travel after all, but still.It is the disgrace called Thor. Ragnarok/Infinity War completed his awesome story arc, he finished his journey, becomes the high king of the nine worlds (or something).In Infinity War, he had one purpose. To avenge his people and his family. But no! Turns out those 6 movies was not what Thor really wanted. All he really wanted was to tour the universe in a space ship!So instead of leading his people in moments of their greatest needs, he passes the throne onto a traitor and coward and run away to bully a man who lost his mother when he was 5, brought up by pirates and had to kill his own godlike father. Some people find that funny. I guess he was too awesome even for the WOMON POWA, so he had to go. WTF? Thanos Hitlerised into just an another egotistical maniac. Yeah, the reason why IF was so great? An actual antagonist! Constant bullying of Ant-Man was not that funny either. The more I think about it, Endgame is the new low for Marvel Universe. (Not counting Captain Marvel, I mean...) Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 style. Yes, Age of Ultron. I will have to think twice before seeing a Marvel again. The story direction is  completely wrong.",-1
"The only reason to see this movie is for its climatic final act. Everything else leading to this is just an exercise in futility. Perhaps left to smarter writers, the whole time-travel, alternating timelines idea could've worked; but here it's just a mess.",-1
"This movie was a huge disappointment. A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel about which I can talk for hours. I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is. And it seems like it is working.",-1
"Just dreadful. Almost all of this entire 3+ hour snoozefest was nothing but a weepy gaze backward at the most bloated commercial cash-extraction machine in cinematic history. Unless you are a 35-year-old man-boy with a deep-seated need to fork over money to watch a movie franchise pay tribute to itself, you'd honestly come out ahead to burn $12 then sit on your thumbs for 3 hours, staring at a blank wall.",-1
I have seen endgame last night and I was blown away by the stupidity of the plot and dialogues. I am not a die hard fan of the franchise but 2:30h of sentimental whining and grieving + 30 minutes of proper action just doesn't work for me.,-1
"Considering how much I enjoyed Infinity War, I was surprised by how disappointing Endgame was.  Not a bad movie by far, and some of the things that bothered me won't be an issue for others, but I expected more.  With that said, the beginning and ending are the best parts, so you'll likely leave the theatre happy (even if the movie doesn't sit too well as you digest it).I was surprised by the amount of humor.  And even though I thought the jokes mostly landed, it was weird that in a universe where half of sentient life disappeared there are so many people cracking jokes.  I would have appreciated a darker humor until the snap is reversed.  I just felt it undercut the stakes and loss the characters would be feeling after their defeat in the last movie, even if a bit of levity is needed for the audience's sake.The thing that bothered me the most was the reliance of time travel as a plot device.  I can accept time travel if it's just kind of in the background, but the moment a movie tries to make it seem real is the moment I can't accept it anymore.  The worst part of Endgame is that despite telling myself several times, ""Just ignore it and have fun!"" the movie spends a lot of screen time on the time travel plot and is constantly trying to justify it.  In the end I couldn't get past it and it made the middle of the movie really sag.",-1
"I really want to like this movie. But sadly I don't. And even sadder...probably many feel the same. Talk about a collective cacophony of underdeveloped, rushed and even forced plots. I usually judge a film on how much I would want to see it again. On a scale of 1-10 for second viewing, I'd rate this a 2. It just wasn't that enjoyable or interesting. The end result was very predictable and took very few chances-if any, unlike the last film. To have Caps die as an old coward (choosing his gf over the lives he could've saved/impacted) and Iron Man dying a hero made me really conflicted. This film just really feels patronizing and insulting in a 3rd Matrix, Lost Finale/Seinfeld Finale kind of way. And it makes me VERY concerned for Star Wars Ep.9. The 3 hour length isn't what sours the experience. It's how much frivolity and sloppiness that plagues those 3 hours. Its ultimately very forgettable. Even the choppy slapped together editing seems to have lost interest half way through. Its a shame as I feel this was a dead end that Infinity Gauntlet created. There was no successful way out of that rabbits hole...And while Captain Marvel wasn't as integral as many fans feared, she still felt forced into the plot/film and actually served as a major disruption to the flow more than anything. I walked away from this film felling very ""meh"".",-1
It is a ten year build with ten years of plot holes that pile up. The most notably happen when a lot of Age of Ultron plot points are forgotten and characters lose abilities and information for Thanos to be a threat. The humor in this movie is too overpowering considering the situation. How they did Thor and Hulk dirty was a major turn off. This movie didn't live up to the hype. The last 30 minute is good but then you are left with mainly plotholes in that fight as everyone waits their turn while dispatching easy killable villains and disappearing air support that ignores enemy ships for Captain Marvel. The whole run the gauntlet is stupid considering they have an army of teleporting sorcerers who can also just teleport Thanos to pieces or just drop him into the upper atmosphere. Hulk doesn't redeem himself from his lacklust performance in Infinity War.,-1
"I had to multiu-task watching this mish mash hodge podge. I think the task of wrapping up so many movies stood against it, and for those who did not see 80% of the previous movies, this one had to many ""meaningful"" scenes that meant nothing to me. As usual with all these, a major clice-fest, but then what do you expect with a movie aimed at action-movie mentality. Effects are nice, bla bla, but yawn, we know they will be, obvs... a bit more depth maybe, naaah, that's asking too much. 4/10",-1

"Completely impossible to follow plot line, sound level fluctuations in the movie made it horrible to sit through.",-1
"The movie is pretty bad. The time travel mechanics make no sense, the choreography of the end fight doesn't make sense, it lacks any sense of geography (even Michael Bay fights have some), this is specially disssapointing because the Russo Brothers previous film did had some. In contrast this is an overcrowded mess, that is impossible to follow, I hate CGI generic debris, you can tell they were just hitting the air at a green screen. The main villian is such dissapointment from the previous film, such a downgrade, Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 comes to mind. For all the cameos, not a single contributes to anything, you could remove some and the plot would be the same,the dialogue is mostly interchangable among most characters too. Worse part is the conflict that made the heroes lose on the previous film, as well as the Pseudo-Civil War where nobody died), is resolved off-screen. Nobody learns anything they just win by facing the equivalent of a Baby version, that's cheating.Then everyone knows you shouldn't alter the past,.nor create alternate dimensions for selfish reasons. What this hero does, it makes Rick & Morty's Rick Sanchez look like a decent person. Is creepy. And resurectimg characters is always bad",-1

"Unlike its predecessor, the last movie of this tetralogy (so far) becomes a dragging and tiring movie, simply because it is the climax of 22 films that preceded it.The movie is too long (3h01min), has several backstory, not taking advantage of 20% of them, and some characters are poorly developed, such as Rocket and Nebula.But not everything is lost. The script works very well the ending of the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johanson) and the other avengers such as Thor, Hawkeye and Hulk are left as supporting, but that add something to the story.Avengers: Endgame, tries to imitate the formula of its predecessor (Infinity War - 2018), but fails to deliver a cohesive script, leaving a bitter taste in the viewer's mouth.",-1
"If you aren't a Marvel fan, this movie will not change you into one. It is a predictable, boringly long mess of fan service. Especially the characters are all like one another (the funny cool ""chad"") and don't go through any character arc. Some fans tell me that they do, but over the course of tens of movies. And that is not a good thing. The only interesting character, Thanos, was completely bland in Endgame. Instead of giving him some more screen time, we got selfie jokes, Fortnite jokes, other childish jokes. I get that this movie is for all the 9 year olds out there, nothing wrong with that. But making such a hype out of it... The hype is not worth it.",-1

"I absolutely hated this movie, i thought it was boring, poorly written and inconsistent...-Time travel and the way it is used in this movie absolutely sucks, it's so convenient and almost without negative repercussions to the main time line..-Thor and Hulk are a joke in this movie.(Thor is too weak even with two hammers and the Odinforce and is fat, drinks alcohol and plays Fortnite and Hulk is basically Ruffalo with CGI and doesn't participate in any action scenes)-Captain Marvel and the way she is portrayed in this film is horrible, she just comes and one shots Thanos's entire army while Thor with 2 hammers and the Odinforce can't do anything.-in a movie with time travel elements in which they just resurrected the entire marvel universe how can Tony Stark die?can't they just go back in time and get him? (we have Gamora from the PAST living in the PRESENT now!!!)i get it that the actor's contract is ending but still..-Thor abandons his people and leaves with the Guardians???wow that was laughable, they are probably planning for a New Asgard series so probably because Hemsworth can't participate they just had to put him out of the picture like this?-Falcon is the new Captain America?why???isn't he just a regular guy..why not Bucky for example?-all female superhero moment...the amount of cringe!!!-the tone of the movie is like this...pointless drama with bad jokes-the last battle is pretty impressive but doesn't last for long and captain marvel totally ruins it...-they should have used the marvel cosmic beings and give this battle much bigger scale, after all thanos affected the entire universe not only earth.-Nebula kills her past self while being in the present and SURVIVES??!?!?!?-Pepper Pots is able to pilot the iron man armor like a pro, better than War Machine.-Dr. Strange does absolutely nothing in this movie, he just collect all the heroes off screen and opens some portals in the end, oh and he uses an aoe spell for half a second. These are only some of the flaws with this movie..Of course it will make a lot of money but it's mostly due to the hype and Disney's promotion which is essentially the best in the market...",-1

The only redeeming factors being a few decent jokes, The first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes.Extremely overhyped and really just for the casual Marvel audience. Two extra hours of lame fan service.

That was so horrible, it deserved at least two points down for the movie. Another two points down for that Captain Marvel saves everyone moment. Like, really? I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",-1
"TL;DR: Avengers: Endgame is a massive extravaganza film with a lot of enjoyable moments, but without soul, purpose, artistic vision, philosophy or literary value. It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming ""products"" by the Disney;Marvel brand.Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU.The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending.-RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable.-As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good.-In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event.The Bad:-Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples.As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose.-Direction:The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see.The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the ""past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos"" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some ""cool"" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem.In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: ""Yibambe""! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters.",-1
"poor fanservice, politically correct and class B comedy: repeat.Things that shouldn't be in a sequel of a movie with the darkest finale ever.It's slow, full of stupid gags, characters like thor and hulk completely wasted and ruined.Everything go as you expect:the plan: go back in time, get the stones, bring everyone backWhat happen: go back in time, get the stones, bring everyone back...OOPS past Thanos discover by LUCK everything, with the other one dead was OBVIOUS the past one would have entered.Past Thanos stronger than the one with GODLY POWERS, Black Widow die and everyone don't even care, the scene with the girls...horrible movie after infinity war",-1

It's truly sad to think that the ""feminist"" aspect of this film doesn't believe enough in their own power to stand WITH their male counterparts without first changing the ""strongest"" characters at their core. There were so many times they tried to deliver humor that was strained, and too many plot holes for a 3 hour film. Finish with an ending that truly disappointed my kid. My 12 year old says he's now a DC fan!",-1

"You got to be kidding me. You call that the best conclusion for all the marvel films since Iron Man. That was the most boring movie ever. Come on, time travel. That was the stupidest climax of this Movie. If you want to make this movie great about time travel then you got to be logical which place and time to be than other random time and place to receive something important. If they want to go timeTravel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones  when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future. That would have make much easier instead going to different timelines to get the stones individually and Black Widow could have been alive. The first half was so boring to do timeHeist. So overall, let’s pretend this movie never happen and use my own creation for this movie without time travel and continue with the other future marvel movies. I’m was pissed of on this movie.",-1

Really boring and disappointing movie.  Quite predictable.  Hulk and Thor are made ridiculous.  The worst movie of the MCU.,-1
"I loved infinity wars, and seen/liked nearly all of the other movies in the series. Unfortunately Endgame falls short in quite a few areas. I certainly don't mind a long movie, but that comes with the assumption that something is happening in that time. There was some good, but mostly a lot wrong with the movie which I'll break down.Pro:-For the most part the final fight scene is well done and visually exciting.-Tony Stark scene is sad, but ultimately a fitting end to his character arc.-Quite a few jokes, though perhaps this is unfitting for what is supposed to be an action film.Cons:- Captain Marvel completely ruins the pace and tone of the movie. Every scene she is in leaves you rolling your eyes. This Mary Sue character is so much stronger than every other character and avenger that while their entire team is trying to save one planet, she is off  saving ""thousands"" (in her words). Her story, and character is unconvincing, and she is so incredibly powerful that she upstages every other person in the movie. She destroys Thanos's battlecruiser (A ship the size of a small city) by literally flying through it with her fist. But not before being blasted by its cannons (And shrugging it off totally unaffected). The same cannons that had just annihilated the entire avengers compound into literal rubble. She then proceeds to eliminate half an army before fighting Thanos who has all infinity stones. Earlier Thor, Captain America, and Iron man all fight Thanos without the stones, and are beaten. Yet Thanos with the gauntlet is no match for her as she shrugs off a blow from him and laughs about it. I was worried by every scene with her leading up to this point that she was going to swoop down and single handedly save the day, which would completely invalidate the ""teamwork"" tone of the rest of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally written that way but changed last minute.- Iron man and Nebula are floating out in space, and who comes in to save the day? Yes you guessed it. The incredible Captain Marvel. Super being who is able to fly through space unprotected (No need for oxygen) at apparently faster than light speeds, and has the omnipotent knowledge of exactly where these two were floating at somewhere in space. Tony Stark is supposed to be a super genius, and he has the help of an android. Yet they couldn't work together to create some solution to save themselves? No. Instead super being swoops in on a literal golden beam of light to save the day. Disappointing, emasculating and anti-climactic.- The time travel plot was pretty disappointing, and left a lot of loopholes. Such as thors hammer not being returned, and how changes in the past wouldn't affect the present. How they would be sent to an alternate universe. Well then I must point out that the original universe that thanos half destroyed would still persist, and upon returning the heroes would be sent to another universe which they would then change. It opens up so many holes in the story I don't have enough room to go on. Why time travel? 10 years of writing, millions of dollars, and they resort to that cliche? Very disappointing.- Thanos is ambushed and killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Really? Everyone going into the movie is expecting a secondary power to counter his, or a long build up and occasional conflicts with thanos or something of the sort. Instead he dies without a fight, the movie has no villain, and instead they spend 2 hours making jokes and playing up overly dramatic scenes.- Thanos himself was ruined as a character. He was the ultimate villain in the previous movie, but in this one he barely seen any screen time. He had no character development, and ultimately after a trivial struggle with every other avenger, he was brought down by Captain Super Being and her sidekick Scarlet Jedi.  Leaving him distracted just enough to let Tony Stark snatch the stones away under his nose.- Thor was ruined. Really sad what they did to him. He had so much passion and such a great story arc in and leading up to Infinity War. Then they turned him into a fat drunken clown. Literally making booze jokes through nearly every scene, being called fat jokes, and generally being worthless and unheroic. - Dr.Strange, perhaps one of my favorite avengers did nothing the whole movie but hold back a wave of water for a few minutes. - No post credits scene. Every single other movie had a final scene at the end of the credits, but not the final movie? Not even a joke reference? A dozen people stayed in the theatre I was in and were all audibly disappointed.Overall the movie was enjoyable through parts. But I feel like Disney is going to ruin the future marvel movies. I think Captain Marvel is a good indicator of what is coming ahead. Unrelatable super heroes with unbelievable powers flying through space and saving thousands of planets at a time. Honestly...What villain can even compete?",-1

"So I went into this not expecting much, and really not knowing much about the universe. (Only watched the first two...got dragged into this by my boyfriend)There’s several issues with these movies that explain my score;- they spend far too time coming up with an hour worth of cheesy jokes that the movies feel to drag on and on.- Several of the action scenes scream B-movie cheese (Japanese scene (unneeded), several fight scenes toward the end)- They made captain America at the end seem like he went from 100% saving the world/perhaps resurrecting Iron Man to “nope screw people I’m retiring”- A lot of bad acting as usual in these kind of movies- they make alcoholism seem like it’s okay and something to joke aboutCouple pros:- some of the more well done action scenes were fantastic, visually pleasing- Robert Downey Jr and Peter Parker (forgot the actors name) at the end had a fantastic performance",-1
"The Good- There are a couple of clap worthy moments. Hawkeye, Captain America, and Thanos were good in this movie. ........That's all I got.The Bad- My god, so much. The script reminds me of my book reports from elementary school, hurriedly doing it the night before just so I had something to hand in. It appears the same approach was used here. No thought put into it whatsoever as it shows with horrible pacing, lazy dialogue, and the worst plot device to resolve the story (extremely lazy writing). Once powerful characters are reduced to pure comic relief (Thor, Hulk). They can have their comedic moments, but also show they can tear it up when necessary. They decided not to do that in their infinite wisdom. The force fed female/S JW agenda is on full display here having the women be the most powerful characters in the movie.This is done with the subtlety of being smashed over the head with a cinder block. For what is supposed to be the finale of 11years worth of movies, there is virtually no action because who wants to see that in a superhero movie? That took some David Copperfield-level magic to pull that off, but they did (slow clap). Brav-o. The movie also runs for an obscene 3 hours when 2 would have been fine. We needed to see everyone hug in all combinations. Essentially seeing the same scene five times.The emotional scenes miss like me using the toilet in middle of the night due to the phoned in script. This movie has the energy of an 88 year-old woman on a dialysis machine. A lot of low talking and me not caring.The Deal- This movie is as big a disappointment as the Phantom Menance was for me 20 years ago. The studio knew we would watch this movie regardless of what type of crap stew they brewed up. Sadly, had they stuck closer to the source material, this would have been a lot better. But the hack screenwriters thought that something that a high school student could come up would go over........and unfortunately, it did. This movie is all hype. Phase 4 will be an SJW gush-fest as prefaced here. They did not mention one of the stones in the movie......The refund stone.",-1
"This is the absolute worst marvel movie I have ever seen. I thought I was angry about the ""strong independent women don't need no man"" forcing. I thought I was angry about the inconsistencies. I am angry about the end of the movie, when Tony was at his weakest, barely managing to stay alive. Tony's wife indirectly killed him by telling them to give up and die. They had a chance of staying alive, you don't just tell someone they can die when they're barely conscious. Especially if it's someone their semi-consciously responding to. What actually happens when you tell someone that; They're a loved one and telling to die?; Must be better to die then. The absolute nerve and the ignorance. I don't even know how to describe this other than a massive betrayal from the character that doesn't even know they were the final nail in the coffin. I was personally insulted when they told him that, and a bit more when they cried after killing them. I would rate lower if I could.",-1
"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.",-1
"This movie had GLARING plot holes and character inconsistencies but i'll focus on just Cap here.   How did he show up as an old man?   If he was able to go back in time and rewrite things, which is what they tried to explain was not possible, then how did he go back and marry Peggy?   Also,  Tony just died and the universe was just attacked----and he decides to sit on the bench after that?    Also,  how did he return the stones in it's original form i.e. the space stone back into the tesseract.   Once everybody calms down you'll see that this movie was a gigantic mess that the Ready Player One climax does not make-up for.    Act 1:  Leftovers TV show  Act 2:  Back To The Future/Time Travel that fails to stick to it's own logic  Act 3:  Ready Player One/fan service.",-1

"I thought the movie was ok but not great. The writers obviously have no idea about time travel and since that underpinned the whole premise, the entire movie was one big plot hole.  Hulk was a ridiculously unlikable character and the loss of Black Widow was unforgivable.  The SJW agenda found its way into the movie which again was a big disappointment.",-1
"22 movie has led to this garbage. Thank you MARVEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU FKING IDIOTS!I have Spider-Man tattoo in my whole arm, you know i'm a fanboy but this. this is just pure garbage movie.First of all, it's not even half of Infinity War.This movie is basically most expensive fan fiction movie of all time. All of the movie is just Star-Lord's Thanos slapping cheap. All of the motives, events everything is that much ridiculous.1) You fcking shove Captain Marvel into MCU before this. She is absent from movie. What the hell you forced her to MCU at this point. You don't need her.2)Everyone waiting for Hulk's revenge, but oh no! He is peacefull and powerless. It's not the same Hulk, he is shorter, smaller, and not powerfull as old one.3) You make Thor OP at IW, but oh no! He is fcking a loser now. He can't even hit a punch on Thanos. Everyone waiting for Thor but you wasted him. He killed Thanos with full Gauntlet but now he cant even hit stoneless Thanos. Bravo Marvel, f*cking Bravo.4)Some things should stay in comic pages. Comic has lots of ridiculous things. Captain America and Mjolnir is one of them. It's not working like that, that hammer won't go who ever calling it. You can't stay consistent with your rules. Also that idiot is not worthy, after everything happened Civil War and Infinity War is because of him. He is the biggest douchebag in MCU. Worthless bastard.5)Ant-Man's come back... All of the universe saved because of a rat. If there isn't a rat there all of the universe is just fked up...6)14 million possibilities and 1 success. It is really this one? If you saying this, i will look for all of the possibilities. You should make a ending with no other possiblities. But I can assure you the is a possibility there is Thor is not an idiot or Captain Marvel is actually usefull. Or Doctor Strange is just fking do something other than holding water... Marvel, you are just bunch of idiots you know. Hell, there should be a timeline that Thor hits Thanos' head or Ironman tooks stones and just runs, there is no need to use those but they should kill him you know, so he is used the stones... Captain Marvel can destroy that thrash can gauntlet with power, why the hell she didn't do that? Also why the fk Thanos did go to Nidavellir for Gauntlet? Stark can do this with Aluminium not even vibranium you know? And Hulk cried 5 hourse after stones but Ironman just talked with no problem... This movie is just **** garbage.",-1
This movie was way too slow and too long. I don't mind a movie that is slow if it has great dialogue and characters. But I'm not a huge fan of most of the superheroes in Avengers. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be deeply invested in all of them. The only interest I had was with Thanos. The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.,-1
"I'm not a comic book person, but I've enjoyed some of the MCU movies. Number one, in my book, was the first IF movie. I was surprised that Marvel made something with some true stakes. I also appreciated how the wove so many plotlines into a cohesive and entertaining movie. It flew byford me. This installment, in the other hand, dis not. The first half of the movie dragged. Sure there were some high points, but few and far  between. And I figured out the plot very quickly. It certainly wasn't bad, but it did not live up to the first installment for me. In the end, I was disappointed.",-1
Overall a bad movie. Movie is too slow and lacks action. The grand finale comes down to random heroes making a big entrance and holding the gauntlet for a few sec. Just a shell of Infinity Wars. Pity.,-1
"Infinity War was a 10 for me...this was a 4.  Too many long & drawn out scenes.  Some jokes they took too far or went to the well too many times..THOR cough cough...Everyone will praise this film, I think it kinda sucked.",-1
"Major plotholes, terrible pacing, long movie for no reason(could've been 2 hours easily),  Hulk is Yamcha, forced characters, crapped on Thor, many casuals didn't care for the Stan Lee cameo, cheap drama tricks, etc. Over done time travel story with plotholes. The only redeeming factors being a few decent jokes, The first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes.Extremely overhyped and really just for the casual Marvel audience. Two extra hours of lame fan service. Disappointing. If I was new to Marvel I understand why it's big but I'm not. It's generic if anything.",-1
"I finally watched this movie.  And I came away terribly disappointed.  Infinity War barely held its story together and allowed some characters to shine.  This sequel seemed to be written and directed by people with Attention-Deficit Disorder.  It jumped from one set of heroes to another entirely different set not once or twice but several times.  They kept changing the nonsensical time-travel rules to fit whatever the writers wanted to happen next.  There was never any core group of lead characters for the viewer to latch onto and to actually care about.  This unfocused and nonsense ruined any feelings of danger or threat.  So, when the strongest women in the universe saved the day I no longer cared.  Blow the Earth up!  Who cares!  They'll just go back in time again and start over.  Maybe with better writing.",-1
most overrated film of 2019.This film is to boring why all the new super hero films has same scenario?,-1
"Thanos finished the world, understandable, but why that long face? Everyone knew from the start that world was going to come back (and with new hair styles) so why spend first 60 minutes being so serious?They followed the formula all 2-part movies do (Kill Bill Vol-1/2, Harry Potter and Deathly Hollow 1/ 2) where first part is all about action and next one a lot drama with action in the end. Lesser known avengers could sue Thanos for discrimination as he left most famous Avengers to undo what he had done. But in the same way, Thanos can sue Disney and Marvel for strategically delaying Captain Marvel Movie Hence Captain Marvel was kind of immune to the disintegration phenomenon. Not only that but every single Avenger was saved with no serious injury in a massive missile attack by Thanos just before the final better. So was Antman who was in Quantam Realm, strangely 5 years were only 5 hours to him, but not to the Wasp who stayed there for some 30 years but aged 300 years which should have been 30 hours only.Logic behind saving the world was so grossly cliché and confusing that most of the time it was hard to catch up. Introduction of time machine and promise to not engage with past selves or play with the thread of time was so lame. Eventually they had to come up with the most stupid reasons to fill up the black holes they created in their stories. Like previous movie, End game has infinite stares. In an action packed movie where every response is predicted, a serious focus on a character and his dense stare feels awkward. Infused drama about every character, we know how much everyone thrives for science yet they refuse in the start to only come up with the solution in snap of a finger. Be it Bruce Banner or Tony Stark. Greatest science inventions like time machine are shown to be as easy as boiling eggs. Time travel not only revives dead and disintegrated characters but makes avengers even more strong. I wondered if they thought to go back in time and fix 9/11.Since writers were extremely lazy while developing the idea for the movie and could not weave in all the events in the past with their retrospective effects, they brought in an alternate reality approach so that they could mess up other realities to save the one they are in. And avengers in other realities are so lazy and sacrificing that they didn’t lift a finger to save their realities because Disney was not making movie about their reality.Character profile and development is perhaps strongest if we minus the excessive drama. Tony and Captain get the strongest storyline. Natasha’s departure and response by rest of avengers was perhaps forced into the story. All these years and no one knew if she had a family? What kind of friendship they have? Finally, the most commercial idea of passing Captain America’s shield (franchise torch) to someone colored. There was a Wonder Woman moment when all females assembled to secure Captain Marvel’s trip to time machine. Special effects are nothing new and same goes for the weird creatures.End Game might try to invoke that feeling which you have when a very long series end but it infuses more drama and action it actually needed and the ending in every possible way was predictable and weak.",-1
"Hulk's arc = completed off camera. Thor's ark = we undo the work of the last 3 Thor movies and infinity war. Iron Man's arc = emotional but predictable. Captain America's arc = completely out-of-character and selfish. Black Widow's arc = emotional and powerful, but it was a poor sendoff for a great character. Hawkeye's arc = his Ronan plot was underdeveloped and seemed a bit pointless, but overall his was the most consistent arc of the movie aside from Black Widow's. Overall, this movie was a huge fail, and makes me not want to watch the old films since their plots mean nothing after Endgame destroys them.",-1
"Boring, trunkated characters, plotholes, stupid story, badly managed drama. Way to long... All events are predicted from A:IF easily, no surprises. Worst possible ending of the saga. Goodby my dreams of an epic conclusion. And a last question... How can universe can still exist if the one that make it like this disapear before doing it ? Storytelling noobs... Stop ruining my childhood superheroes...",-1
"Boring and stupid. Ok, may be final scene was good, but the rest part film was boring and stupid.",-1
Extremely overhyped for no reason i suspect Disney paid reviewers to give good scores. Plot holes were everywhere and half of the movie was chit-chat and weird mix of drama and comedy. At the end it felt like a cheesy movie made for teenagers i was not impressed,-1
"I was expecting a lot from the Endgame, it is a culmination of many years of MCU movies, and the plot of this movie just added more questions to the ones I had when Infinity War ended. Too many plot holes, but hopefully it can be explained in the next phase of MCU.",-1
"The only plus to this movie, and the only reason for score 1 in stead of 0 is ... no, it is 0. The makers of this movie have failed miserably. It is difficult to make such a movie work, with so many characters, but they get an F nonetheless. They could have done a much better job. Let me repeat one thing about superhero movies. They are inherently dumb. The whole premise is just dumb - people with superpowers. But it's a wonderful fantasy - people with superpowers. That's why the creators must put in extra effort to mitigate the dumbness by making the best possible story. Some superhero movies do a better job at that than others. This one does not, and I rank it really low, along with 'Thor - The Dark World' and 'Batman - The Dark Knight Rises'. I shall only mention two things out of many, that make this movie so awful: Thor and Feminism. Let me address both. Thor, one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics and the great Dignitary, has generally been portrayed terribly in the movies - all of them, with the possible exception of Infinity War. First, he's been bland and a spoiled brat in Thor - part one, then he's a stupid, uninteresting oaf through a couple of movies, and then they start introducing clownish aspects to this character, which culminates catastrophically in this movie with fat, drunk, whiny, bum Thor. It is unforgivable. To make things even worse, they don't even let him get in a single blow against Thanos in the final battle. He just gets brutalized by Thanos, and Captain America basically takes over his supposed role, and battles Thanos properly. In the end, they put him with the Guardians of Galaxy. Since they are a bunch of clowns, he's should fit right in, but another problem there is that Chris Hemsworth is simply not funny. Maybe he could have been very good for the role of Thor, had they written the character properly, but he's no comedian, however hard he may try. I guess some people thought that he was very funny being shocked and zapped, he was not.As for the feminism: I like feminism. I also like a good sandwich, but if you shove it violently down my throat, I am going to hate that particular sandwich, and I'm going to hate you. I am talking about that scene during the final battle when ONLY female characters come together to support Captain Marvel in whatever she was trying to do, I don't care. If you desperately want to push societal issues in what is basically a lowbrow superhero movie, you should nonetheless try to make it less painfully obvious and stupid.MCU finale is a total fail. I watched it, many people watched it, you'll watch it, but it is bad.",-1
The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed. Overall i am unsatisfied with how Endgame went and i do not agree with the high ratings its been given just for the sake of it.,-1
"Here's the skinny. You'll watch this 3 hour borefest for only one good reason; the 20 minutes of worth-while content that happens in the form of a battle. Before that, and after that-not worth watching. The Battle still isn't as good as the Airport battle in Civil War. It's a disappointing movie.",-1
"Infinity War was a wonderful epic film yet this doesn't feel like it is written or directed by the same people.They 'cleansed' Thor and Hulk of their toxic masculinity making them literally laughing stocks. From IW when Thor had an amazing journey, he is just embarrassing in this. And Hulk whose MO is losing his **** and smashing things up is suddenly all touchy feely - what the hell. It's almost like there is some kind of agenda in needing to clip the wings of the old guard before the next phase.The time travel feels silly and gimmicky and nothing more than self indulgent fan service. They effectively ape IW by having the Avengers go on a stone search just like Thanos did in IW. It makes scenes such as that on Vormire have little or no tension because we saw it all in the other film.Tony and Steve's arc doesn't get any decent closure with Tony reverting to the self absorbed douche bag that he was when the series started and Steve being his effective verbal whipping boy. All the efforts to make Thanos engaging and empathetic are cast aside so that the journey we saw him go on in IW is just thrown in the trash and we are given the 2014 Thanos who is just a cardboard cut out evil bad guy. This isn't the guy that we saw in IW who made the sacrifice on Vormire and could empathise with Scarlet Witch.For no reason whatsoever, he has decided against his life goal of a 50% cull of the universe to complete annihilation of everything even though he hasn't had the opportunity to experience the 'fruits' of his cull. He is also now ridiculously over powered. In IW, Stormbreaker nearly kills Thanos when he has all six stones yet in Endgame, he has no stones or gauntlet and Thor can't mortally damage him with Stormbreaker AND Mjolnir.I've seen many try to dismiss these as easily explainable plot holes but the reality is that they are just lazy writing and pretentious directing. Seemingly the makers got themselves into a hole with a fearsome yet sympathetic bad guy, cooked up a time travel device that created nothing but a slew of contradictions, removed the straight line linearity of IW, invested all the money in a final battle that looked like an over inflated DC mess rather than matching the clear and beautifully simple fights/battles from IW and felt the need to hobble some of the biggest characters to signal their social justice virtue.This disappointment of a film which must rank as the Russo's worst MCU film smacks of what happened with Joss Whedon and the Ultron film. Too much pressure and studio meddling , straight jacketed by a dose of political correctness and a loss of stand out creativity to be patched over with fan pleasing guff.Given the Russo's previous stellar work, I expected this to be sure fire hit but what I got was a hot mess of a film that tried to tie things up but rendered itself a little vanilla in doing so. What a wasted opportunity , what a sad end to what had been a glorious 10 years and what a disappointing follow on from the fabulous Infinity War.",-1
"Way, way, waaaaaay, way, way too long. Nothing else is even worth mentioning because it's 3 times longer than it should be.",-1
"Unlike its predecessor, the last movie of this tetralogy (so far) becomes a dragging and tiring movie, simply because it is the climax of 22 films that preceded it.The movie is too long (3h01min), has several backstory, not taking advantage of 20% of them, and some characters are poorly developed, such as Rocket and Nebula.But not everything is lost. The script works very well the ending of the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johanson) and the other avengers such as Thor, Hawkeye and Hulk are left as supporting, but that add something to the story.Avengers: Endgame, tries to imitate the formula of its predecessor (Infinity War - 2018), but fails to deliver a cohesive script, leaving a bitter taste in the viewer's mouth.",-1
"It's the hype that kills you.......after Marvel took some brave risks with IW which gave provided the film with substance and emotional gravitas, they directors, unsurprisingly, chose to unwind all of that and essentially, with the exception of the death of Iron Man, return everything to the status quo (yawn). The most interesting character from IW was Thanos, who, rarely for a Marvel villain, had a clear motive and was an emotionally complex character whose obsession with his own destiny destroyed everything he loved, in the name of 'saving' the universe. Interesting stuff. So do the writers do? they kill him off in the first few minutes, only to bring him back via time travel, which results in the Thanos of this film becoming another caricature of a villain; this Thanos has not been through the Trauma of sacrificing his own daughter, or through the hard graft of travelling across the galaxy to acquire the infinity stones. He's just another over-powered villain here. They should have found a more creative way to make the 'original' Thanos a viable threat, which would have forced the writers to come up with a more imaginative way of tackling Thanos for the second time, instead of using brute force in (another) final battle sequence. The humour was pitched at just the right level in IW, there's even more of it here and as such the film is tonally confused and feels more like Thor:Ragnarok than a sequel to IW. Captain Marvel is also grossly underused, especially after the not-so-subtle hint and the end of that film that she was going to play a part in Endgame. The time travel plot is incredibly inelegant and I'm still not sure on the logic that it doesn't really matter what you do in the past because it won't affect the future anyway? It was a device solely used to revisit some of the old Marvel movies, which is shameless fan service but I'm not necessarily against fan service and I'm sure it was a fun nostalgia trip for a lot of people. The filmmakers also do not really explore what life is like on Earth post Thanos' eradication of half of life on the planet - yes it's quieter and people are still sad, but there was a real chance to explore some interesting questions as to whether there was any (admittedly brutal) sense in what Thanos was trying to achieve (there is a moment where Cap comments that a pod of dolphins were seen because the rivers are less polluted due to less human traffic, but that is quickly quashed). However I appreciate most Marvel fans are not paying to see an intelligent comment on the problem of overpopulation. So what does this all add up to? an average Marvel movie where there are no real surprises or deviation from the standard formula. IW was by far a superior film but any sense of venturing into the unknown that IW established was quickly eradicated by a click of the studio's fingers.....",-1
"not as good as infinity war,slow fan service and the most sjw scene ever made",-1
"While it's a definite improvement over its snoozy predecessor, this latest installment in the franchise gets some things right but misses the mark on others. It's refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't place an overreliance on special effects and action sequences, choosing (wisely) to take a more human and personal approach to telling its story. It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid). Die-hard fans will no doubt love this, but, to the less initiated, this is likely to come across as a somewhat half-baked effort.",-1

"Very disappointing vs. the great Infinity Wars. What happened to all the witty dialogue? The writing was just plain poor this time around. It felt like the writers were lazy and took the audience for granted. Cheap fat jokes just don't cut it in this movie. Instead of the joy we felt watching Infinity Wars (and the first Avengers movie), we felt one big ""meh"" after watching this one. With very few exceptions, the interesting character interplay and humor that was present in Infinity Wars was absent in this one. It's frustrating to see this movie getting such great reviews from ""professional"" reviewers. With all the money spent and made with these films, couldn't they hire good writers?",-1
Avengers Endgame was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever spent in a movie theatre. The entire movie is boring except for about the last 20 minutes.

First it's a full hour too long.  Lots of slow pacing trying to establish relationships that either were or should have been established 5 movies ago.  But the real problem with the film is it's inability to get you to suspend your disbelief.  Speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy are anchored on a single idea.  There may be something fantastic, but it's internally consistent.  If I have a magic broom that lets me fly, it can't suddenly in the middle of story develop the ability to make pop tarts.  If it does, anything becomes possible and the story has no point.  Endgame is riddled with internal inconsistencies.  Because of that, suspending my disbelief became impossible.

"Possibly one of the most overrated movies of all time and in my eyes the weakest of the marvel movies produced. All credit from this movie comes from the stunning visual effects and the well crafted score composed by Alan Silvestri, however when the budget is over 350 million dollars, it’s hard for the vfx to look bad. The pacing and tone of the movie was all over the place, and seemed split between going for a lighthearted feel like Guardians Of The Galaxy, or a more serious outlook like Infinty War. The movie was fun yes, but for a decade of build up and being a sequel to the arguably the best mcu movie of all time, Infinity War, the movie fell short in meeting the expections of what I had in mind. They turned my 2 favourite hero's of Hulk and Thor into characters only there for comedic value. A decade of character development just for them to lose all of that in Endgame really ruined the movie in my opinion. The movie suffered from an extreme imbalance between comedy and seriousness, and for that reason I believe it to be the most underwhelming marvel movie of all time.",-1

"Realmente no estamos ante evento cinematográfico del siglo. Es una película entretenida llena de conveniencias y algunos huecos de guion. No es insoportable pero tampoco es, como ya se dijo, lo mejor del Aquí algunas inconsistencias:- Capitán A. y el martillo de Thor es un gran Deus Ex Machina- La rata que libera a Ant Man es la mayor conveniencia de la película.- El hecho de que Thanos pudiera viajar al ""futuro"" es imposible, pues solo se había entregado dos frascos de partículas Pin a cada personaje, por ende entre Nebula y War Machine solo tenían 4, 2 fueron gastadas cuando ambos viajaron al ""pasado"" y la última cuando War Machine vuelve al ""presente"", por ende la última solo pudo ser usado por Nebula o Thanos, aunque finalmente todo su maldito ejército va al ""presente""-El hecho de que hayan tirado el guante con las gemas me hace pensar en una película slasher cuando los personajes tiran un arma a pesar de que están en peligro, en el caso de Avengers a pesar de que tienen el arma más peligrosa  -A su vez si hubieran usado el guente en la batalla con Thanos la película no se hubiera    alargado más, aunque esa batalla si estuvo buena.-Capitana Marvel al comienzo y al final llegando porque sí.- Al final Iron Man le quita las gemas a Thanos ¿cómo?, no importa mientras que los buenos ganen.- Aunque no afecte a la trama el Cap. viejo del final no tendría sentido si se sigue la lógica de la película, si aquello que sucede en un ""pasado"" realmente no afecta al futuro.",-1
Overrated and overlong. It needs to be trimmed to 2 hours and it would be much better. Action is good even if there's not enough,-1

"After Infinity War I had high hopes for this one. That's why the dissapoitement struck hard. There are a lot things done wrong with End Game and because of the below I gave it a 4/10:- Thor and Hulk put aside for no reason. They tried to make them some kind of funny characters, but it did not work.- Plot holes, plot holes everywhere. Just for example:(ultimate sacrafice for the soulstone - Hawkey lost his family already; time travel; Ant-Man rescued by rat; Thor took Mjolnir to his timeline; Nebula did not travel back in time, but stayed on the ship and got caught instead; Thor almost killed Thanos when he had the gauntlet with all stones and could not beat him without it; Tony takes all stones away from Thanos, just like that). There are many more, but those are the major ones.- weak, dull and unnecessary jokes - pace and narration problems. It felt somethimes like there was a struggle betwwen two concepts and both ideas were implemented.- forced and unnecessary ""strong independent women to the rescue with Spiderman"" sceneFor me a Marvel fan it is a huge disappointment, especially after such good Infinity War. End Game felt rushed and produced without a plan and highly inconsistent. A shame though.",-1
"This movie is slow, with an awkward plot, it's just a muddle of stupid references and cameos. Just plain boring.",-1
Worst avenger movie out there. Dont waste your time. Everything about this movie is terrible excluding capt using thors hammer,-1
"Disappointing. Movie ruined all the original characters, and 3 hours was not necessary (and don't bother sitting through the end credits to hear an audio clip).Black Widow was a bad-ass in all the movies,yet, they made her character teary-eyed and overly emotional in almost every scene. and she had no real fight scenes? What? And she wasn't even given a decent death scene, just drop to your death.Captain America - giving up the shield so easily, it's like a slap in our face that he regretted being Cap America -- and wait, how was he able to stay in the past. That would mean there were 2 Steve Rogers in that timeline. And why couldn't he tell Falcon, who's he married to. Duh, we ALL know. And what?? He was able to get Thor's hammer. NO way.Thor - another character, he was bad-ass in all other movies, then reduced in this movie as drunk, emotional idiot and renounced his ""throne"" because he's not a Leader. What?Hulk - he's suppose to be a genius too but this time he couldn't figure out Quantum Physics. But Scott Lang had the idea? AH?? What???Clint - all of sudden a murderer (of criminals) and he was able to take down cartels on his own? hmmm.. really?Fury and Hill - were reduced to cameo appearances.. UGH. Horrible.The only character that stayed true was Tony Stark. His actions and dialogue made sense, and his death made sense too. This was suppose to be a comic book movie, not a bad soap opera or scifi movie.",-1

"I know Ironman is the central character but I thought they could at least give equal amount of show time for other late coming MCU superheros. Particularly, I really don't like how they treated Hulk and Antman. They changed a lot from the comic, and we all know the plot is tailor-made for few stars who will be leaving the MCU after the movie. After all, the movie is just a tremendous fan services and astronomical amount of paycheck for Disney executives and movie stars.",-1
"Endgame is a totally fan service,  only assemble scene save this movie,  infinity war is better",-1

"Contains essentially what JUSTICE LEAGUE (even the dreadful, Warner's-mangled first version) does, and with the same bombast Zack Snyder has (sometimes quite fairly) been accused of.  Overstuffed with Marvel's crew to the point where the individualism the brand has been lauded for is all but lost, the final battle seems stretched and inconsequential.  Any comparison with Snyder's corrected version of HIS apocalyptic showdown will show (as it has ever since DC learned--yes, largely from Marvel--that character is the key to storytelling), just how shallow Endgame really is.",-1
"Boring. CGI overused. Yuck. Half of the movie, I'm slept. Ugly storyline. Biggest Disappointment.",-1
"Lets be fair we had high expectations and russos did not deliver, infinity war was way better than this. To begin they ruined thor after he got so boosted up, tons of loopholes, weak time travel plot, the only saving grace is the last fight.",-1
"They say they want to make a good story, 11 years marvel, or 11 years from several characters? really many hole plots, and lazy writing. the infinity war is very good, but endgames make urinating less painful than seeing their stories.I have to say, i have a mixing feelings, as the fan. the services was good, but as movie lover, it didn't",-1
"I wasn't expecting much based on the Trailers and I was still dissappointed. Infinity War was a great movie so it would have been better to just end it there because in order to bring back all their cashcows they came up with the most contrieved time travel plot I have ever seen. These things rarely work in movies and this time is no exception.But even if you turn your brain off at the stupidity of the plot there is very little left to this film. Most of it boils down to ""Member this, guys?"" moments that don't really add anything that we didn't already know to most characters and in some cases ruin them completely(Thor). Also, you can easilly remove about 60 minutes of this movie and it would actually be improved as much of it consists of characters trying to convince other characters to ""just do it"". We know that they eventually will, so why spend that much time on it?How's the action? Boring and devoid of tension. Also, in very small doses. Other the the final battle, that looks like the cutscene of some gereic video game from 10 years ago, there are very few action scenes. How are the visuals? Like most Marvel Movies, cheap and bland.And finally, for the characters, the thing these movies are most praised for? Let's just say that the character who gets the most satisfying arc in the series is freaking Nebula. I guess Cap sendoff is alright, Tony's sacrifice could have been great if there was any buildup to it. the Hulk is still a joke and Thor? Well, after many movies of development where he needs to learn to be a good king he realizes that he just needs to be himself, a fat, drunken slob and leave What's Her Face from Ragnarok to lead Asgard. Truly the best ending to a series ever!",-1

I'll give it a few points for Rocky Rakkoon, because rakkons are my favorite animal. Is this the last one? Can we be done with this? Please. Its starting to hurt..",-1
"There are way too many plot holes in this work of fiction to even understand what's going on. The movie spends so much time building its own time-travel logic to end up breaking its own rules at the end. This raises a lot of questions about things they could've done instead. Hulk accidentally discovered the secret of immortality and it was completely dismissed as a failure. There's also a lot of inconsistencies. Namely, Captain Marvel one shotting Thanos spaceship and later easily being thrown away by Thanos. Yet, even mundane characters could fight with Thanos on a similar strength for a while. Why didn't those other people one shot the ship if they all could? The movies are getting so ridiculous that some actors -too ashamed to continue- decided to opt out of the next entries by leaving their characters to die.",-1

"It was an okey movie but it really dropped the ball at the ending.1. Tony Stark dies, i can accept it but.... They have all infinity stones + Hugo Strange that can heal any wounds with the time stone so his death made no sense.2. Thanos lost in a unfair match against Team Space in the last movie but in this one hes able to compete with everyone, even Thor that (might been out of shape) had both mjolnir and stormbreaker that could oneshot kill him.3. Mary Sue Marvel had no place in this movie, it hurt every moment she was on the screen.and at the ending where she came in saved everyone and could tank thanos attacks that beat the hulk into a coward because ""gurl power"". Really hoped she would die in this movie.4. Timetravel works if its parallell universes but Captain America deciding to stay in the past for some coochi was pretty bloody dumb and somehow still end up in the main time line?5. Thor giving the reigns to a random valkyrian. Thor is of noble blood and is suppose to sit on the throne, he cant just give it to a random valkyrian that havent been in asgard for over a million years. Would make more sense if he adopted earths democratic voting system instead.6. The girl power moment was cringe and out of place, and the scientist from black panther would have 100% died in a real war. 7. How did Ant-man survive a rocket that could destroy a whole house to the face?But the movie was still okey, but i think this will be the last avenger movie i will ever watch and just keep following Spider-man movies in the future.",-1
"I really don't like this movie. The plot is ""meh"" and it has a lot of unfunny humor. The visuals are great tho.",-1
"This movie was a huge disappointment. A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel about which I can talk for hours. I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is. And it seems like it is working.",-1
"The script and the forced ""humor"" really are a turn off. Just like Infinity War, this is another movie that - though technically polished - lacks substance. I guess 10-14 year old kids will enjoy this movie a lot.",-1
"When half of the universe has been wiped out, when your dear ones were gone and when all hopes have been faded, don’t worry, just ask a big green guy to help you travelling the time and all your problems will be solved. That basically sums up the film. All’s well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life in an Armageddon’s Bruce Willis style to save the universe…how original! All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000’s superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time. Better on the form nothing on the substance if you ask me. But well, to each his own!",-1
The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed. Overall i am unsatisfied with how Endgame went and i do not agree with the high ratings its been given just for the sake of it.,-1
"After being such an avid fan of these (mostly) marvellous films for so long, it's such a shame to have it ended this way.  It still entertained (mostly) but i think that hinged entirely on the fact that i've liked these characters in other movies - and by the time of the very hastily put together 'final battle' which i thought was filled with CGI near-misses - i'd checked out.",-1
"disappointed, overhyped, brazilian drama, indian watching time, not fun like modern allstar nba game.",-1
Fun film but massively overrated. The final battle was a tedious cycle of cliches with nothing but good cgi to back it up and there was no shortage of plot holes and conveniences.,-1
I have seen endgame last night and I was blown away by the stupidity of the plot and dialogues. I am not a die hard fan of the franchise but 2:30h of sentimental whining and grieving + 30 minutes of proper action just doesn't work for me.,-1
"Visually amazing but a mess. It just seems that whoever wrote this was trying to cram in a list pre-determined ideological goals.

"The movie was bad. Not meant for people who actually care about marvel. It contained a lot of plot holes. It was boring. In a lot of scenes I was like, why did they do this? It was filled with a bunch of cheesy jokes. They just dragged the movie so much. Infinity war was amazing but this was just bad.",-1
I feel like my biggest problem with this movie is simply the fact the first half is way longer then it needs to be. I feel like it was drawn out simply so they could make a big show about how the movie is three hours long. Besides that though the movies pretty good. Exactly what most people want out of a marvel movie with the same problems and that's perfectly fine. A fitting end to this era of marvel films.,-1

"(RottenTomatoes)- They delete my reviews frequently and the ratings for movies are not as accurate. There time was good, but MetaCritic's time is now. Thank you MetaCritic for not denying people freedom of speech and being corrupt. The 3 hours was unnecessary. First hour is filled with bad jokes and lines that sound like they were written by 5 year old. They spend time on things that don't matter. We want to see Iron man struggle in creating the time machine, we want to see Captain marvel searching to find Iron-man, we want to see Ant-man being abandoned in the void. We don't want to see people eating with hulk at a dinner talking about how they shouldn't give up hope and that the time machine idea is good. Like, seriously way too much time in convincing people to do things that they shouldn't need convincing of or we DID NOT NEED TO SEE. Then Captain america ruined the whole time theory they set up. If he went back in time and married her, then that means there were 2 captain Americas and he somehow stayed in hiding never got recognized. But then also, in a previous movie he banged her child, so presumably that means either she was never born because he married her. OR perhaps that means Captain america always was with her and then that means he **** his own daughter. But still that would mean that there should currently be one old Captain america and a young one. But we only see the old one. There should be two. And the shield was also supposed to go to Bucky.    This project took years and it is just barely not ****. They made the first one good, so they didn't need to try on this one I guess.    The last movie felt like adults wrote the script, but this one seems like it was written by a girl in 8th grade.",-1
"The movie left a bad taste unfortunately.- Wamen power was pushed obviously in one ""in your face"" scene and of course in every scene captain marvel is in, it was distasteful- Captain Marvel being pushed into the movie with some reshoots is damn so obvious, you can clearly tell her scenes feel very off- Nothing explained about the infinity stones, no conclusion to why what happenned. No answers to what happened to Titan, no answers to the mistery in the wisdom of the stones- First half of movie is very emotional and satisfying- Robert Downey Jr's best acting in his carreer was in this movie- Why did Loki die? What did he mean by ""you'll never be a god"" or ""sun will shine upon us once more""? No answers. And he seems to be permanently dead.- Thor is the most wasted character in the movie. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him an alcoholic Zakk Wylde with broken character riddled by insecurities playing Fortnite! He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in the end he gave away what he already had as well, but what of his vision in Age of Ultron? What of his wisdom that pushed him off to go searching for infinity stones?- Movie feels to be changed dramatically after a sudden change of mind and if there is multiple cuts / alternatives for this movie this is not the best one among them, for the depth, immersion, feeling of a structure do not exist in this movie. All the characters and events are miles wide, inch deep.- This Thanos is not the same great antagonist we saw in the IW. He is shallow, insensitive, as a matter of fact, shallower than Ultron.- Action scenes are too chaotic, the fight sequences that focus on characters we saw in IW do not exist in this one. Just too much blend CG.When I came out the theater I asked myself: ""Are these the same guys who made the Infinity War?""",-1
"I know I’m going to P people off, but you could skip 1 hour in and know what happened. It’s inferior to the original because of the ending. Thanos won Endgame and that was surprising because in 99.9 percent of Superhero movies, they always win. This time, they lost. I won’t spoil the ending, but I will say they won. And this is the highest grossing movie?! Come on people.",-1
"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren’t enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in ""Quantum.”",-1
"movie had it's moments of ""awe"" and some very beautiful shots, but as a whole it was a huge disappointment, once the honeymoon phase is over in the next two weeks you'll see that with audience reviews and. scores.the good--Cap and Starks storyline came to a very nice conclusion--Cap being worthy of the hammer and assembling the avengers was the peak of the film--widow and hawkeyes moment before the soulstone was one of many tearjerkers of this movie--the visuals were amazing as alwaystoo much bad...--too long and not enough action, like over 2hrs of talking and just less than 45mins of actual action.--too much cringe from Cap Marvel every single scene she was in, way too OP, a healthy Thanos with all stones attacks her and she DOESN'T EVEN FLINCH AND JUST SMIRKS LIKE A MORON!! WTF is that??? lmao also she's so forced and such a last minute addition that there are too many plot holes with her. she's busy saving other worlds??? really?? Thanos is the biggest villain in the universe and has annihilated countless worlds within her jurisdiction, so where the **** was she? why hadn't she ""handled"" Thanos already???--they did Thor DIRTYYY, technically the most powerful of the earth heros, and goes through his character arc of Jerk hero full of himself, the downfall and finally his rise and belief in his ""godhood"" and completing his circle of the Thor that's close to his comic counterpart and king of Asgard....to being a basic ""fat clown"" in this movie, as if thats not bad enough he gives up his kindgom cause ""girl power"" so we can have a black female leading ""norse gods"" cause that makes sense.--Hulk isn't even hulk, he's just a nerd making jokes and never gets his chance at redemption and a cool fight with Thanos.--Black widow is killed off without her even getting her solo movie after having been in the movies the past decade...--the time travel arc was lame as hell and was not original whatsoever--Story was all over the place and convoluted ASF.honestly there's so much more to go on about but I'm sick of writing, will just post my reviews and forget about this movie ASAP. the rest of the MCU doesn't interest me aside from Guardians, especially if Thor is gonna be the new ""leader"" lol",-1
"This movie's plot is half-baked with lots of holes. Not a lot of action scenes, too much backstory about lives of superheroes. Thor did not really play an important part in the movie. Overall, it seems like the movie was a little cash-grab.",-1
"This review contains spoilers...For a 3 hour movie there is surprisingly little action. Central characters like Thor and the Hulk did hardly anything and were just lame. Captain Marvel was supposed to be their knight in shining armour but she was hardly in it at all and at the end fails to best Thanos one on one, even though she's just blasted through the middle of a giant space cruiser. I really thought she would be his downfall. If you're going to hype her up that much, make sure she's really a solid element of the film. Too much dialogue, too many sentimental moments. Ending it on Tony's Stark's funeral was just a downer when really you wanted some real cathartic, happy times after the bleakness of Infinity War. It's not even clear how Stark gets the stones from Thanos as one minute they're lodged in this glove and then next minute Stark has them without you even knowing why. Annoying that Black Widow has to die and they couldn't figure out another way to get the soul stone. Hawkeye's rage filled murdering spree near the beginning feels kind of forced and weird. Stupid humour that went way over the top, like Thor becoming a complete loser. It was funny for the first five minutes but when you realised how much they'd nerfed his powers you just felt disappointed, especially after how badass he was in Ragnarok. He was almost discounted from contributing altogether and was just pathetic. Stark's banter with his daughter was just cringey. Why did hulk wearing the infinity gauntlet for 10 seconds manage to restore the earth again? That wasn't explained but maybe I missed it. This always happens, when the hype is so high things go the other way. Captain Marvel's movie was dire as well. For me, although DC have a worse track record, Marvel still haven't topped Wonder Woman. Their new joker movie looks top notch too. Just hoping Guardians 3 is good.",-1

Overall a bad movie. Movie is too slow and lacks action. The grand finale comes down to random heroes making a big entrance and holding the gauntlet for a few sec. Just a shell of Infinity Wars. Pity.,-1
Thank God it's finally over. Infinity Wars was a rarity in the superhero world in having a real flesh and blood antagonist with depth. But they turned Thanos into cardboard in Endgame. Big budget junk food in visual form. Totally forgettable.I'll give points for technical proficiency but for the 3 hours of smaltz and saccharin mawkishness I'll give nothing.,-1

That was so horrible, it deserved at least two points down for the movie. Another two points down for that Captain Marvel saves everyone moment. Like, really? I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",-1

"Endgame is a mess. The only positive things that I have to say is the character development, I only like the the character development because of the fact about how many people they have to remember. Now the negative stuff. Let's start off with thor, Thor was so poorly written when he didnt kill thanks who should've been more to determined to fight back instead of being that fat slob we got to know, He should have been motivated to fight back. Black widow. Here is a bit more respect to marvel most of the time I think black widow is wasted but in endgame she had a decent role before she died. Professor hulk,  professor hulk was a nerdy mess the cgi at some points almost made me puke. The pacing was okay, but now the big daddy the plot holes. The plot holes were almost as bad as the ones in captain Marvel here are some I found in the first 30 minutes. Endgame Plot Holes why would fury still be holding on to that pager after 20 yearsHow did the avengers find the pager and bring it back to the compoundPeter quill ship does have a transponder the avengers would recognizeAlso captain marvel doesn't have anything to track a signalWhen a ship runs out of fuel it doesn't just stop it keeps its momentum and keeps going and eventually slows downHow does captain marvel talk and breath in space and survive the vacuum without imploding but in captain marvel she needed a helmetHow did she bring iron man and nebula down to earthNebula when she gets back says she knows thanos s whereabouts but her and Tony have been on the spaceship for weeks and tony told steve he knows nothing Conclusion endgame got a solid 5.",-1
Time travel is the laziest style of writing. It is like the ridiculous force healing in Rise of Skywalker. A decent movie but not worth the hype.,-1
"I promised never to go on Marvel movies after awful Age of Ultron, and other movies were pretty average to say at least. But sometimes, like in case of Civil War and Infinity War they were pretty good. So I expected from Endgame the same - that it will be a ""good"" Marvel movie. But oh my god... It was just horrible. I will not include spoilers here, but I will say one thing - writers should abandon idea to include time travels in the movies. It doesn't solve anything, but creates just enormous plot holes. Nuff said. 3/10, just for visual.",-1
"I saw the movie yesterday. I'm not a Marvel fan but I saw the Avengers saga and the last movie was good.- Captain Marvel appears at the beginning of the film with some effects taken from a class B movie following a scene with an extremely arrogant dialogue on his part front of the other Avengers. (Come on! you did not appear in the other movies!). Then she disappears during the next 2 hours of film (I guess she went to take a haircut in that time) and she returns to destroy Thanos' ship in a ridiculous way. No one on earth is capable of destroying it? Or do something? Come on!.- The Incredible Hulk takes two whole movies without even giving a slap. It is one of the most important characters in Marvel comics and his scenes seem that they were of a film of Shrek (With a little more of intellect).- Thor... I have no words to describe how they humiliated one of the strongest Avengers. Marvel should never again print a Thor comic after this. I hope to make a team with him in a videogame or see him in a pub sometime. (Or maybe one day I find him playing bowling with Walter).- I did not finish to understand the trips in the time. More precisely in the scene that Antman returns to the present. I do not remember if it was in a previous movie or when he set up that machine. A friend told me what happened in one of the 23 MCU movies. But if to understand 1 movie I must see 23 movies something is wrong. - Excessive humor in the whole movie. It also happened in all the saga. There are moments of tension that need some seriousness in the movies but are ruined by some silly joke.- Unnecessary feminist fight- I did not like the dialogue of the final scene with Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" and Ironman answering ""I am Iron Man"". I think it would have been better if he said ""We are The Avengers"".Throughout the saga there were moments that seemed to be watching Iron Man movies with sporadic participation of some characters.That final dialogue finished confirming that the saga should be titled as ""Iron Man and The Advengers""- I think the duration was long, maybe 2 and a half hours (or a little less) would have been enough.They missed the opportunity to give a great closing to a saga that began from minor to major.I want to congratulate the sound director and his team. The rest take a break and rethink if you want to continue doing bad movies.",-1
"Although, I like Avengers series, this movie is diasspointment of the year for me.",-1
"Endgame is confusing with their way of time travel like theirs makes more sense, it can be really boring, Nebula is stupid but the ending was cool.",-1
