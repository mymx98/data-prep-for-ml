review,sentiment
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is about memories, nostalgia and tons of fan-service moments. This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene.My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in ""Infinity War"". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the ""Fortnite"" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable.Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension.The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like ""Captain Marvel"" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again).The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it.7/10.",0
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is an excellent commercial movie,Marvel spent 10 years to prepare a wonderful show.Straightforward stories with a spectacular effects is good for every audiences.8.0 Great",1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is nothing short of a spectacle that serves as a poignant and deserving conclusion to the legendary  ""Avengers"" saga that defined a generation, not unlike ""Return of the Jedi"".",1
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably one of Marvel's best movies yet. It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all  the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying ""there's wine on the ship."" Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life.Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have.",1
"(RottenTomatoes)- They delete my reviews frequently and the ratings for movies are not as accurate. There time was good, but MetaCritic's time is now. Thank you MetaCritic for not denying people freedom of speech and being corrupt. The 3 hours was unnecessary. First hour is filled with bad jokes and lines that sound like they were written by 5 year old. They spend time on things that don't matter. We want to see Iron man struggle in creating the time machine, we want to see Captain marvel searching to find Iron-man, we want to see Ant-man being abandoned in the void. We don't want to see people eating with hulk at a dinner talking about how they shouldn't give up hope and that the time machine idea is good. Like, seriously way too much time in convincing people to do things that they shouldn't need convincing of or we DID NOT NEED TO SEE. Then Captain america ruined the whole time theory they set up. If he went back in time and married her, then that means there were 2 captain Americas and he somehow stayed in hiding never got recognized. But then also, in a previous movie he banged her child, so presumably that means either she was never born because he married her. OR perhaps that means Captain america always was with her and then that means he **** his own daughter. But still that would mean that there should currently be one old Captain america and a young one. But we only see the old one. There should be two. And the shield was also supposed to go to Bucky.    This project took years and it is just barely not ****. They made the first one good, so they didn't need to try on this one I guess.    The last movie felt like adults wrote the script, but this one seems like it was written by a girl in 8th grade.",-1
"....a masterpiece. What was created here with phase 1-3 is simply film history (Spiderman Far from Home then brings phase 3 to a final conclusion). With part 1 and 2 (Infinity War and Endgame) the crown of the Marvel films is secured and I can only be grateful for this visual journey.Endgame in particular is a rollercoaster of emotions and brilliantly staged. Exactly the right film for fans and everyone else will get their entertainment costs, because boredom is not to be found in these 3 hours.All in all, a snap of the fingers of perfection.",1
"11 years and 20+ movies and it all builds up to a meh of a movie.It was average. The good parts were good, the bad parts were really, really badJokes were excessive in what should have been a dark film.Ant-man coming back after 5 years shows Marvel Studios don't even care about their own continuity. If 5 years in real life is only 5 hours in the Quantum Realm why was Janet old in Ant-man and the Wasp? People still mock the Martha scene from BvS but let's be honest, the ""Cap freezes up and stops fighting when someone mentions Bucky"" nonsense is way worse than the Martha scene. It's used AGAIN in this one. It's ridiculous.They borrow from Dragon Ball Z for how time travel works, that way they can mess with time with no repercussions.Widow's death was emotional manipulation, and ultimately felt forgettable after the fact. Tony's death was the only really good part of the movie because it felt like the right way to end it, especially knowing how the MCu started with Tony being a selfish playboy.Steve somehow can go back in time and live out his life and be old in the present, with no changes to the current timeline? It's so stupid. And he gives the Shield to Falcon? Ugh. They really are going full SJW with future movies, aren't they? Forgettable movie. It was average at best and as usual the critics show how biased they truly are where they call this movie ""Once in a generation"" when it's just another MCU movie that is meh at best. Rotten Tomatoes also shows the bias used to protect the scores of MCU movies (not just them deleting negative audience ratings for Captain Marvel but legit critic score they manipulate). One critic gave the film a 2/5 but their review was labelled as ""Fresh"". Mind you, a 2.5 for BvS was considered ""Rotten"". Amazing how that works, isn't it? How a 2/5 is Fresh but a higher rating is somehow rotten for a non-Disney comic movie? But there's no bias (sarcasm)They further ruin Hulk and Thor, and seeing Hulk dab had me ready to walk out of the theater. I gave this a higher score intially but remembering the dab brought my score down from a 4 to a 3Seeing Captain Marvel easily destroying a full powered Thanos and shrugging off his blow like it was nothing shows how big of a Mary Sue she's really going to be in future films. And I honestly believe before hey did a bunch of reshoots a few months ago she beat Thanos and saved the day, and after seeing reaction to her character and Larson's comments against a large chunk of their potential audience they changed it to Tony stopping Thanos with the stones to keep from alienating more of their fans with that shoehorned in character.This should have been the end of the MCU. But the franchise prints money because of people like the guy who made headlines for seeing Captain Marvel 116 times and the guy last year who saw Infinity War over 100 times in theaters. So bad to average movies will continue to dominate box offices, prompting other studios to follow suit, meaning the days of good filmmaking will continue to fade into memory",-1
"22 films and 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame is the end of an incredible stage in film within the blockbuster branch.You can hate it but definitely you must recognize that what Marvel Studios built with this franchise is something that will hardly be seen again in this industry.Superhero films existed before Iron Man and the MCU but the ambition of this project completely surpassed everything else.That the audience that perhaps didn’t care about comic books at all was so involved with this saga and followed it until the end says a lot. The tears that the people next to me spilled in the theater only confirmed it.Like Infinity War this film may not be able to sustain itself without the whole concept but as I said at the time about that film I come to repeat here as well. This isn't about that.If after 22 interlaced films you can not understand it, what's the point of saying more about it?Its achievements are numerous. Even with three hours of duration the film never feels heavy, perhaps a little overwhelming for the amount of things happening at the same time but the narrative hardly falls into bumps that make it feel slow or boring.The story is emotional enough especially in the end, even when they reach levels never seen before of fan service, everything feels in its place and I think the most devoted fans will be satisfied.The final battle is spectacular, finally I felt as if I were watching a comic book taking life from the pages to the big screen because the scale and the number of characters make it the most epic battle of the whole saga.But even in spite of its achievements it also has its faults.Despite the lenght you can feel the holes in the story. The visual effects vary too much because in some points it looks pretty good and in others it gets to look very bad. Even the CGI varies in quality because the work is so detailed in Thanos but so simple in Hulk.Even the soundtrack in spite of the quality is not as emotive as that of Infinity War.And for the same reason due to the size of the plot, many characters end up reduced to very small moments in screen.And of the three characters that closed their circle in this film, I must say that the ending of Black Widow was quite bad compared to that of Iron Man and Captain America.Avengers: Endgame closes a cycle and closes it with solidity in a very entertaining show.It's the film that was expected to be and as I said closes a monumental chapter in this franchise in terms of narrative and characters and at the same time laying the foundations for what is to come.Will a new saga of 10 years and more films follow? I don't know, and part of me doubts it, but no matter what happens in the coming years, the achievements of this franchise will undoubtedly be unforgettable for a lot of people.",1
"22 movie has led to this garbage. Thank you MARVEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU FKING IDIOTS!I have Spider-Man tattoo in my whole arm, you know i'm a fanboy but this. this is just pure garbage movie.First of all, it's not even half of Infinity War.This movie is basically most expensive fan fiction movie of all time. All of the movie is just Star-Lord's Thanos slapping cheap. All of the motives, events everything is that much ridiculous.1) You fcking shove Captain Marvel into MCU before this. She is absent from movie. What the hell you forced her to MCU at this point. You don't need her.2)Everyone waiting for Hulk's revenge, but oh no! He is peacefull and powerless. It's not the same Hulk, he is shorter, smaller, and not powerfull as old one.3) You make Thor OP at IW, but oh no! He is fcking a loser now. He can't even hit a punch on Thanos. Everyone waiting for Thor but you wasted him. He killed Thanos with full Gauntlet but now he cant even hit stoneless Thanos. Bravo Marvel, f*cking Bravo.4)Some things should stay in comic pages. Comic has lots of ridiculous things. Captain America and Mjolnir is one of them. It's not working like that, that hammer won't go who ever calling it. You can't stay consistent with your rules. Also that idiot is not worthy, after everything happened Civil War and Infinity War is because of him. He is the biggest douchebag in MCU. Worthless bastard.5)Ant-Man's come back... All of the universe saved because of a rat. If there isn't a rat there all of the universe is just fked up...6)14 million possibilities and 1 success. It is really this one? If you saying this, i will look for all of the possibilities. You should make a ending with no other possiblities. But I can assure you the is a possibility there is Thor is not an idiot or Captain Marvel is actually usefull. Or Doctor Strange is just fking do something other than holding water... Marvel, you are just bunch of idiots you know. Hell, there should be a timeline that Thor hits Thanos' head or Ironman tooks stones and just runs, there is no need to use those but they should kill him you know, so he is used the stones... Captain Marvel can destroy that thrash can gauntlet with power, why the hell she didn't do that? Also why the fk Thanos did go to Nidavellir for Gauntlet? Stark can do this with Aluminium not even vibranium you know? And Hulk cried 5 hourse after stones but Ironman just talked with no problem... This movie is just **** garbage.",-1
3 **** hours..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,0
3 hours is too long for a movie. The special effects were great. And it was cool to see all the characters together. But they either need to add an intermission or just make the movie shorter.,-1
47 out of 100 . Enjoyable somewhat but is clearly set out for closure needing fan base.  Poor script and dull emotional baggage bonded with lucky plot scenes over and over again. Compared to the comic unimaginative and another same old loophole movie dragged out over 3hrs...... entertaining in parts but the 6 rolls in every scene for every instance with these defeated bunch brings eyerolls for the most part. Especially the absolute silly she scenes eyerolls pretty much just barely keeping you awake at this point. Thanos character is inconsistent and stripped down  let alone others in the movie.  Plenty of plot holes and sub plots that are just to rubbish to expand on. The last movie was much better and I'm sure many needed the enjoyment of closure around the story. But a stained finish to the marvel seris really and kinda left out a movie for everyone. The movie was about bringing back and includeing everyone but the movie was catered towards certain audiences and lack luster scenes of luck isn't up to scratch and was a below par mashup . Long . Lazy.,-1
"A 10-year adventure of great stories accompanied by a great cast hurt me a lot to say goodbye to the avengers, a great closing although it is not the final ending.",1
"A bit of a mess...But it might grow on me.This movie was not nearly as tight and orderly as Infinity War.  It had way too much going on, got bogged down in too many needless scenes that dragged too long and poorly told jokes that did not stick like they usually do.The final battle did not have nearly as much action as expected.  And since it was against time-travel Thanos it really didn't feel like it was against the real Thanos from Infinity War.  A missed opportunity.The Russo Brothers said they wanted to dedicate this one to the fans.  If you want to please the fans, then make a great movie.",-1
"A film that really needs no introduction, all us superhero fans have been waiting for this moment for so long and it’s finally here. I still remember seeing the first Iron Man movie in the cinema and I never would have thought it would bring us here. As always this is a spoiler free review but I do recommend avoiding all reviews until you’ve seen Avengers: Endgame for yourself. Honestly you should avoid all reviews and social media in general because not all of us are adhering to the #DontSpoilTheEndgame request by the Russo Brothers. So if you’re the type of person who would intentionally spoil a film like this for someone else you’re the type of person who deserves to be wiped out with a single snap of the fingers.Set immediately after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is trying to come to terms with the devastating effects after half of the universe have been wiped out. The remaining Avengers are determined to do whatever it takes to try and undo Thano’s actions. I wouldn’t be a huge fan of all the Marvel movies, Age of Ultron and Civil War for me had a lot of problems yet what saved them was the characters and what drives Endgame is the characters we’ve come to know and love over this long journey. I loved Endgame, my heart was racing, I was on the edge of my seat. All the previous films have led up to this moment and no time is wasted diving straight in. With a three hour running time it’s not the type of film you want to buy a giant bucket of coke for unless you’re prepared to leave the cinema to use the bathroom, because don’t let these so called online bathroom guides fool you, there is no part of Endgame worth missing. I can’t speak for everyone but those were the quickest three hours of my life. Despite that I did feel a certain few characters were not given the screen time they maybe deserved, though I understand it would be difficult to give everyone their moment with a cast this big, even with the lengthy running time it just isn’t possible. Though maybe we could have done with a little less of the Hulk eating lunch and a little more Okoye, whatever I’ll get over it.You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer along with the film. There’s nothing better than being in a packed cinema screen with die-hard fans of the franchise. A spectacular cinematic achievement with a very satisfying ending. A real sense of closure, yes that means no post credits scene so feel free to make a mad dash for the bathroom if you’re not a blubbering mess by the end.It may go without saying but yes you really do have to have seen most of the other Avenger movies, if you haven’t you really won’t get much out of Endgame. Highly recommended but honestly I don’t need to recommend this one do I? You’ve already seen it, it’s made over 1 billion on it’s opening weekend and will continue to break all the records.",1
"A fitting conclusion to the infinity war saga for the mcu. Humorous and emotionally compelling, Endgame is one of the best superhero movies of all time.",1
A good concusion to a mind blowing series of movies. I'm happy with how everything turned out even though I'm dissapointed with the character treatment of Thor and Hulk. An epic conclusion.,1
"A good ending for Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. Those 3 Battling Thanos at the same time was the best thing in the movie. Hulk was hilarious, i wish he got to fight Thanos too. Hawk Eye were finally used properly. But there was alot more bad than good in this movie. The Female Avengers Movie setup felt so forced no ones excited for that. Pepper Pots as Iron Man again? it didnt work in Iron Man 3 and it dam sure is not going to work in future movies. Captain Marvel, shes is just the worst..too OP to care about her future movies. Judging by the direction they are going, i see that this is the last Marvel Movie i will ever need to see. Its been fun.",-1
"A great ending to a long-running cinematic storyline. The acting was great, and the movie's length worked to its advantage to set scenes before diving into main plot points. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was stellar especially, and Tom Holland was especially enjoyable during the final, chaotic fight scene. It is not a perfect movie, but a great watch with a tear-jerking ending, a great end to Tony Stark's character arc.",1
"A great finale to an amazing series, however, due to several plot holes, and obvious ways the could’ve defeated Thanos, too many things seemed unrealistic, the action was great, but was yet another disposable CGI army, Thanos seemed unrealistically more powerful, Iron Man’s death seemed avoidable, they had the time stone and somehow they couldn’t undo Iron Man’s death? Boring at times, too long, it faield to get me interested in the next movies (besides Far From Home) but a solid conclusion.",0
"A irritating and tediously longwinded movie, that has spoilt the series for me.  Mawkish and far too long, 3 hours of my life that I would quite like back.",-1
A JAW-DROPPING love letter to comicbook fans and the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters. INCREDIBLE!,1
"A little bit of a let down after everything leading up to it. I would have given it a much higher score regardless, if Marvel hadn't put their political agenda's in the film. -They have a scene where they throw in a gay character with absolutely no benefit to the movie, then never seen again. -Then there was Brie Larson at it again. Thank goodness they gave her barely any screen time. Unfortunately that was too much screen time. Every comment she made was condescending, arrogant, and annoying. Terrible Character. Marvel should have definitely used this movie as a way to kill her off from the series. -Then this obsession with empowering all the female characters. In fact they have this one horrible scene where Captain Marvel is trying to get the gauntlet through Thanos' army and only all the female character line up together to protect the gauntlet and back her up. I could totally imagine a ""Girl Power"" banner in the background. I did a face palm in the theater.-Going along with empowering females, they also make the male characters useless. Hulk is worse in this movie then he was Infinity War, except now they also screwed up Thor. Besides Iron Man, Thor was the only other person who deserved to win this. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him a fat, alcoholic, useless, and unmotivated character full of insecurities. He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in fact he gave away what he already had (such as the visions and coming in to save the day in Infinity Wars).-The rest of the male characters where all very submissive and weak around the females while the women acted strong and NEVER once showed any weakness.-They ruin this movie with PC cultural and Feminism once again (not sure why they haven't learned from the Captain Marvel flop). I am no longer going to be seeing Marvel movies in the theaters, they are becoming corrupted by this liberal junk. I go to watch movies to enjoy myself. Not to get political correctness and feminism rammed in my face.",-1
A little dissapointing movie for me . Time travel in the movie sucks and the way that they killed the original Thanos in the start of the film was really awfull,0
"A lot of plot holes, Captain Marvel with the speed above light to bring Iron Man back, Nebula bringing all Thanos' troop without even a **** Pym Particle.In the previous installment Thor almost killed Thanos equiped with the 6 gems, now he gets kicked in the ass by a Gemless Thanos just because he got fat? (WTF IS THAT?)TerribleGet better MCU.",-1
"A mediocre ending to a nice start, too many politically correct themes forced inside the filming ruined also the pace of the action.",-1
A more than worthy closure.AVENGERS ENDGAME is excellent in all aspects.Everything is well balanced.I love the Scarlet Witch.THIS CINEMATOGRAPHIC EVENT IS SO GREAT that there are no words to describe it.,1
A movie that leaves a lot of emotions. Hope for the return of Iron Man and I don't know where Loki will get the infinity stone,1
"A movie that seems like 3 movies fused: A part about regret and defeat, a part about a time heist and another that is the great battle we've all been waiting for.The humor is hit or miss, with some jokes being repeated too many times (Fat Thor). The time travel part creates a huge amount of plotholes, but it's interesting indeed.The movie lends too much time for the first part, filling much of the 3 hours of the movie. The main characters on this movie are the original avengers, whose story ends in this movie. The best part about this movie is how it ties up all the storylines of the MCU in a satisfying conclusion.It is a worse movie than Infinity War but it definitely isn't a disappointment. However it gives me the idea that the future of the MCU won't be that great, seeing as the most important Avengers in the next phase are mostly absent (I still don't see Captain Marvel as the leader of the New Avengers, it is still an undeveloped character).Hawkeye/Ronin's storyline is compelling and Scarlett Johansson works the best as Black Widow in this movie, although her sacrifice scene is a bit odd.The final battle against Thanos is compelling although being time travel Thanos makes it less dramatic. The battle between Thanos and Scarlet Witch could have been more emotional with a Thanos that killed Vision.Tony Stark's sacrifice is compelling as the end of Stark's character development, becoming a symbol for the hope of humanity and the Avengers. From being an arrogant and egotistical man to a selfless yet still arrogant hero, fighting for the future.",1
"A satisfying end to the infinity war saga but the way they did it was also a cheap cop out. Time travel is a cheap way to beat an enemy, albeit the way they handled time travel is refreshing . Marvel could have looked to the comics for inspiration and even extend the thanos/infinity stone saga even more so.This movie is 100% fan service as they close the book on the future of the original avengers bar Hulk.",1
"A sequel that is not as good and epic as Avengers: Infinity War, but is still good enough to leave fans satisfied.",1
"A smart, funny, entertaining, film, with one hell of a battle that brings closure and finality to the Infinity Saga. Personally, I didn't find it as satisfying as its predecessor however it is still a great film that I feel is sometimes brought down by underdeveloped characters. Most of you will leave feeling emotionally wrecked, I left the cinema feeling confused as I'm pretty convinced that timelines are a little wrecked after this. While currently at the time of typing I feel like I might be done with MCU now, I am curious to see how they will be going forward from here.",0
"A very fun and fitting conclusion to a wildly successful saga. Its biggest problem is that it relies heavily on time travel, and while they try to explain it, they constantly break their own rules. Banner explained that when you change the past, it becomes your new present and future. And by returning the stones to their original universe, you cauterise that timeline. So why didn't Captain America staying in the past seriously affect the present? And how did he end up on that bench when you need to be stood on that platform to get back? Why did nobody bat an eyelid when Nebula didn't return when Natasha didn't? And Doctor Strange's 1 in 14,000,000 ""plan"" relied on the chance that a rat would release Lang 5 years in the future, and countless other unpredictable variables that they had no control over...To put it bluntly, the writing makes almost no sense. However, it succeeded in completing many character arcs, kept it interesting and creative the whole time and the dialogue exceeded the average Marvel movie. It was also accompanied by some nice direction, whether it was snappy editing for comedy, attractive cinematography for the more emotional scenes or to show the scale of the battlefield, in addition to having impressive production, sound design and visual effects.",0
"A very mixed bag of good ,bad and meh. They actually could have split this episode into 2 parts and it would have been better because they tried to jam way too much exposition,wrapping up of loose ends and results for all characters into 'only' 3 hours.That didn't leave any time for most characters to be anything more than devices to move the plot along.The last hour makes the price of admission worth it though as a lot happens.Anyone worried about Captain Marvel taking over the film as dominant figure rest easy .It's not that way. Still worth an 8.",1
"A well made film that is marked as the ending for the MCUThe film was exciting and funny, not as well written as Infinity War but easily a top ten superhero movie. I would say character interaction with each other is the best part of this film. If you like superhero or just adventure movies I would recommend this to you.",1
"a word, BRILLIANT!THIS IS THE BEST MCU MOVIE SO FAR AND THAT'S THAT. I will miss this....",1
"“I know I said no more surprises, but... I was really hoping to pull off one last one.”After the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘Infinity War’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. Heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.‘Avengers: Endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. For a movie that’s three hours long, not once did I feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). There's so much going on. The fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. The Russo Brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and I mean every character. I think Black Widow is best handled whenever the Russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. I’m also thrilled Hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps Jeremy Renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.Same thing with Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-man. It’s incredibly transparent that the Russo Brothers really like this character and doesn't dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. They understand his intelligent and used Scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. He basically saves the world (besides the rat).Heck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even Thor, which I don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. While still having a comedic charm from ‘Thor: Ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. He really is the strongest and most tragic Avenger. The other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.Also the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. Chris Evans really grew into the role of Captain America and I can't imagine any other actor playing the part than him. Karen Gillan is often overlooked playing Nebula, as I always thought she nails every role she plays. Despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. What's more to say about these actors than best casting ever.The mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “Infinity War” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. Still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. Thanos is this generation’s Darth Vader.The action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘Infinity War’. If I have to be honest, I shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. Although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but I was never bored during the more slow paced moments.The score from Alan Silvestri﻿ is perhaps the best and most memorable score in the MCU. A mixture of sadness and loss with a booming blast of epic. Perfectly pays tribute to the original six heroes.Now people have complained about the movie having too much fan service, which I personally didn’t mind and couldn’t see the faults, because then again, this entire cinematic universe belongs to them, the fans. The reason why we have 22 movies, 48 hours and 11 minutes worth of movies and this movie pulling in a monster $2 billion worldwide only in 11 days beating ‘Avatar’ that did so in 47 days! While not a stand alone movie, although considering it’s a follow up to the events of “Infinity War”, it would be tricky to do so.For problems: The story had issues throughout and the entire time travel subplot made no sense whatsoever when given a second thought, but then again, how can you make sense of time travel.I didn’t find Captain Marvel solo movie to be all that interesting - both the movie and her as a character, but was hoping the Russo Brothers would resolve that issue and make the character less wooden. Unfortunately even the Russo’s couldn’t save her. Luckily her screen time is incredibly slim, but they literally pulled a Poochie type of excuse when she was absent for a huge amount of the movie’s run time with a “I must go now. My planet needs me”, from ‘The Simpsons’. I must admit, when she did return, I groaned.Overall rating: Despite the problems, ‘Endgame’ still delivers a sweeping epic that leaves the audience feeling whiplash with emotions. Happiness, sadness, joy and excitement. An experience I’ll remember forever.",1
"About the all female scene: as a straight guy, I like that scene. I have seen so many negative comments about it and state the scene is so ""forced"". Well, if we use this mindset, the whole movie is ""forced"" because so many things had to happen at the right place and right time: Tony Stark meeting his father, Steve Rogers getting back with his love of life. Also, if Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Star Lord, Black Panther and Dr. Strange are fighting together in one scene, I don't think people would say it's ""forced"" although they are all males. Last but not least, this whole movie is a fan service. Let's just celebrate the diversity of the superhero lineup. Everyone of them is the favorite for some fans. You don't need to bash others to love one. Thank you!",1
"After being such an avid fan of these (mostly) marvellous films for so long, it's such a shame to have it ended this way.  It still entertained (mostly) but i think that hinged entirely on the fact that i've liked these characters in other movies - and by the time of the very hastily put together 'final battle' which i thought was filled with CGI near-misses - i'd checked out.",-1
"After being the 22nd movie in the franchise, it brings the series to new heights. This movie is best benefited by those who have watched most of, if not all of the Marvel films. Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future. This movie is a roller coaster which can be benefited most by those who have seen many of the other marvel films. Thank you to all those involved in the production of this movie, you have created a great films!",1
"After enjoying Infinity War tremendously last year, I was quite shocked how mediocre and boring Endgame had become in comparison. Marvel movies really start to fail my expectations and I need a break from them.",-1
"After Infinity War I had high hopes for this one. That's why the dissapoitement struck hard. There are a lot things done wrong with End Game and because of the below I gave it a 4/10:- Thor and Hulk put aside for no reason. They tried to make them some kind of funny characters, but it did not work.- Plot holes, plot holes everywhere. Just for example:(ultimate sacrafice for the soulstone - Hawkey lost his family already; time travel; Ant-Man rescued by rat; Thor took Mjolnir to his timeline; Nebula did not travel back in time, but stayed on the ship and got caught instead; Thor almost killed Thanos when he had the gauntlet with all stones and could not beat him without it; Tony takes all stones away from Thanos, just like that). There are many more, but those are the major ones.- weak, dull and unnecessary jokes - pace and narration problems. It felt somethimes like there was a struggle betwwen two concepts and both ideas were implemented.- forced and unnecessary ""strong independent women to the rescue with Spiderman"" sceneFor me a Marvel fan it is a huge disappointment, especially after such good Infinity War. End Game felt rushed and produced without a plan and highly inconsistent. A shame though.",-1
"After reading some of the slobbering, drool-cup-required reviews rating this stink-bomb a ""10"", I now wish I got the see that special-edition version.  Was there an option that I missed at the ticket kiosk to see either the drool-cup version or stink-bomb version?  Because I sure didn't see the same film.Avoid Endgame unless you get to see it for free.  And even then, the 3 hours of your life is wasted; or maybe watch it in the background while you're doing your taxes, clipping your toenails, etc.Oh, and Brie?  Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich. If it's a good sandwich, you'll get a Diversity Cookie.",-1
"After the cullmunation of 21 films and 11 years we are finally here. Avengers Endgame is a Fantastic and Amazing film. Yeah... It's not perfect, but no movie really is.    As a movie i'd give it a 9.9/10    Enjoyment level: 3000/10 Baby",1
"After the mind-blowingly stellar and near perfect Avengers: Infinity Wars, I went to see Avengers: EndGame and was severely disappointed. Despite an admirable performance by Robert Downey Jr, the rest of this trainwreck is easily the worst Marvel movie made in years. Horrid pacing and a non-existent script and the most cringe-worthy performance outshine the admittedly fantastic CGI and strong choreography. It goes to show that a movie even with triple AAA CGI and special effects will fall flat on its face without a coherent and strong script. The Hulk is made into an absolute joke in EndGame, and Thanos motivations are little different from the prequel, except worse. Chris Hemsworth's performance as an Alcoholic Thor destroys what little hope was left for this movie. To say Hemsworth's performance was cringe-worthy doesn't do the experience any justice. Outside of Robert Downey Jr, most of the actors felt flat and uninspired in Endgame. Little is different about the plot from Infinity War, except that Infinity War had a dark twist ending and compellingly developed the antagonist as a villain. In Endgame, Thanos just feels like a substandard cliche, ""I want to take over the world"" stereotype. Despite the phenomenal battle scenes and choreography, the robotic and lifeless performance from the rest of the cast, not to mention aggravatingly horrible jokes and cliches riddled throughout the picture destroy all credibility this film could have had. Its as if the film directors and screenwriters looked at all the elements that were prodigious about Infinity War and said to themselves, ""Who needs ANY of that when we can have cliches?""    Avengers: Infinity War is without a doubt the superior film, and Marvel would be wise to revisit its strongest aspects to improve on the sequel.",-1
"Ah, Avengers: Endgame. The movie that the world was waiting for for about 10 years now? Anyways, let's get straight to the point. This movie is an extremely mixed bag for me. While there's many moments in here that are just breath-taking and badass, there's also a large number of scenes that just had me cringing.First off, let's go over the positives. For anyone who has watched the movie, you know how awesome it was to see Captain America pick up Mjolnir and wail on Thanos. It was a very awe-inspiring scene and was just overall REALLY a fun watch. Similarly to this but with more consequence, when Iron Man acquired the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos' forces away, that was also just as if not possibly more epic than Capt. America's feat of fighting Thanos with Mjolnir. Was also fun to see Ant-Man knock down a Chitari flying whale with just his giant form, but that's just me fanboying Ant-Man.Another positive is the character arcs that both Capt. America and Iron Man go through over the course of the movie as they re-meet old friends and family as they travel across time trying to re-acquire the Infinity Stones. Now onto the negatives, and oh boy is there a bit to cover.First off, this movie, no matter how many people might tell you otherwise, is FULL of SJW moments very clearly. Let's list them off, shall we?:1. Thor, the white male that he is, has grown to be a lardy alcoholic in this movie that apparently can't even take on base Thanos while Capt. Marvel can effortlessly tank a headbutt from Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet? Nice clear SJWism.2. During the middle of the fight with Thanos, a bunch of the superwomen gather up together and start to wail on Thanos' forces, while all the men're just sitting in the sidelines like a bunch of sissies. This just goes to show the same ol', same ol' trope of ""GIRL POWERRRR!"" in modern Mary Sue-filled movies.3. Another showing of feminist/SJW propaganda in this movie is Thor just randomly handing off the title of king of Asgard to the random Valkyrie chick we met and saw only a few movies ago. All of that after seeing him become a tub of lard? His character ruined? It's quite pathetic what they did to him, now he just runs around with the Guardians of the Galaxy and'll do who knows what for who knows how long.4. Capt. America handing off the title of, well, Capt. America to a black guy, specifically Falcon, is another showing of stupid disregard for character in exchange for blatant SJW propaganda. Honestly, it's completely out-of-character for Steve to hand out the shield to Falcon instead of Bucky. He very clearly has a much bigger and better relationship with Bucky, so why hand it to Falcon? It's just dumb and completely takes you out of the otherwise surreal experience of seeing Cap as an oldie.I could go on and on about why SJWism is what's ruining this movie, but it has flaws even aside from that. The movie is very uneventful, and very boring as a result. Many a moment, I'd find myself just wanting the movie to be over so I could take a bathroom break. And many of my friends have made the same claims. It's just not as fun to watch as the other movies, minus those few moments Cap and Iron Man had near the end of the film (but we know what happened to both of them, now don't we?).If you just want to finish off the Marvel movies with a bit of a banger, this is the movie for you. It has some badass moments for many fan favs like Cap and Iron Man, and really builds up the fanservice with the final fight.All this considered however, the movie is absolutely LITTERED with SJW garbage that really detracts from the experience for someone with more right-leaning viewpoints. If you're one of those kinda people like me, do or don't see this movie, but most certainly avoid the assuredly SJW phase 4 of the MCU Marvel Studios will be churning out in the not-so-distant future.",-1
All I can say is that this movie gave me the chills! Truly fascinating. A fitting conclusion that lives up to the hype.,1
"All in all I thought it was good movie, to sum it up in one word bittersweet. There were a lot of plot holes but they were ignorable for the most part. I really liked how they used captain marvel, and that Tony and Thor got some revenge. I thought what they did with Thor was abysmal, they could of handled that so much better than making him the dude. Professor Hulk was cool, but Hawkeye's Ronan story arc stole the show for the most part. The end war was visually stunning and action packed. the 3 on 1 scene with cap, tony and thor was so awesome. This was a great ending to a decade of movies, everyone was tied in at the end, that kind of story telling and character development is extremely impressive. I think that is the end of my MCU experience as they transition into phase 4 I think I have had enough. Thanks Marvel for over a decade of bringing the comics to life.4",1
"All in all, this is a good movie that hits the emotion button quite a few times, but the pacing seemed a little choppy at times and some of the attempts at humor fell flat. I definitely liked it, but Infinity War is a far superior movie.",0
"All right so here it goes. Better than Infinity War? No. Bad movie? Absolutely not. My biggest problem with this movie is that it tries to bite too much and it can't chew most of it. Especially when it comes with the script, Endgame is a bunch of movies mashed together and it works (for the most part). They subvert our expectations in some good ways and bad ways, my biggest problem with this was what they did to Thanos. They kill the original in the first 10 minutes of the movie so the villain of this movie it's another Thanos from another timeline who doesn't have the same experience that the original Thanos has. And he is in this movie for 5 minutes or more. But I think this is my only problem with this movie, they really wasted Thanos which is the best villain (as of 2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is a 180 minutes movie and it really doesn't feel like it is which is an awesome thing and the directors and screenwriters should be commended by it, they really did a good job, the movie is the most fan service and that is great, Cap using Thor hammer is one of the best scenes in this franchise.Overall Endgame is a great movie that tries to do too much but I still think that is one of the best Marvel movies only losing to Infinity War.",0
"All right, movie itself.It's not bad, but it's not excellent.Infinity war is better.Pro:Fan service, Great CGI,Iron manCon:Whatever you complained in Batman vs Superman and SJW star wars.this movie has them.And that's why people are giving ""0""s.I also took one points off because the reference to ""back to future"", it's very disrespectful,Just like what they did in Star Wars.Man, I can't believe ten year has passed. I don't think there will be another iron man in my life time.Thanks Robert Downey Jr. :D",0

"Amazing movie, a fantastic conclusion to a saga that lasts 11 years. Not perfect in the complex, but of great impact and really exciting",1
Amazing! We have been waiting for this for so long since Iron Man started and the Avengers were created. A masterpiece that has undergone a decade in the making.,1
An epic end to over ten years of MCU movies as the arc of the Avengers comes to an end.  This movie is long and I understand it but they could have cut 30 mins. and still told the story just fine three hours just a little long.  It is a must watch for anyone who is a fan of the Marvel Universe.,1

Are they going to make a part 2? They need to consider doing one if they don't want all those past films to end on a fail.,-1
"As a conclusion to so many movies Avengers Endgame hits hard with the nostalgia, really good fan service, epic fight scenes, a good story which is not non-stop action and heartfelt ending. My main problem with the movie was sometimes the humor which for the most part lands but sometimes does not and can be out of place in certain situations. Some nitpicks can be said about some technical or scientifical things but this is a movie with a walking, talking, sentient tree and racoon  so those are minor issues for me. This movie has minor flaws but still the good parts of this movie outweigh the bad parts by a mile.",1
As a marvel fan I honestly dont think I could have asked for a more fitting conclusion to a decades worth of film. Fan service has never been done at this extent without having to forfeit story.I have seen it twice and I suspect I will see it more. Fantastic. Bravo. Thankyou.,1
"As always great action and visuals, terrible plot and storytelling. I'm really disappointed they went the time travel route, it's one of the cheapest storytelling devices, especially when it's used in a completely unoriginal way like this.",-1
"As much as I would love to, I don’t want the current generation of MCU's characters to end. We all loved Robert Downey's Ironman, Chris Evans’ Captain America, and they left a mark in our hearts that can never be replaced. I will root for the next phase of MCU movies, but I don’t think it will have the same allure as the first one.",1
"As the conclusion to the 22 movie Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame shows new ideas on how The Avengers could have lost in the original when Loki got away creating a new branch which will be explored in “Loki”. The entire score is also amazing to the way that the Avengers theme is played by half of the orchestra, and while the scenes leading up to the big battle are slow it all adds up to the best scene in Endgame.",1
"At least, the epic ending of a saga that catch the attention of a generation. Mixed elements of action and comedy gives enough dynamic the full 3 hours, with a crushing melancholic final act. ¿What's next?",1
"Avengers end game : e um filme muito bom quanto a comedia q e muita bem ambientada no filme, quanto a história, e principalmente a ação a ação, referências aos quadrinhos, e por ultimo as roupas q também são um maximo",1
"Avengers Endgame concludes the avengers series with the perfect amount of satisfaction and emotion. The visuals in the movie are just gorgeous, the camera work is great, and the acting is on point. Overall Avengers Endgame is a must see in theaters.",1
"Avengers Endgame feels like a movie where Marvel is patting itself on the back, good job! I don’t think there’s been a Marvel movie that has disappointed me more than this one. Last year’s Infinity War was great, everything was put together after ten years and it had a fantastic ending, a cliffhanger that had us all wanting more. The dramatic ending in infinity war is completely thrown away. Like my god, every real dramatic moment that was happening in Endgame was thrown away with humor. Literally would it be so bad for people to just be miserable, they toss in these stupid one liner’s in every scene, maybe its just me and I find it forced and not funny, but the obnoxious woman sitting behind me was cackling throughout. But really 5 years into the future the Hulk would still be dabbing? Really? Are people even dabbing now anymore? Captain America admiring his butt, Thor with anything he said, and Black Widow staring into the distance trying to cry for Clint while holding back a smile. Humor shouldn’t be used to take viewers out of uncomfortable situations, what’s the point of a dangerous battle for a viewer when they are constantly molded to feel safe with some joke to kill the seriousness. Let’s talk feminism and the pat on the back. During the big fight scene, they took time out to have all the woman stand together to fight Thanos, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. Really? That’s showing how progressive marvel is, that shot is an insult considering only one of those women has been a lead in her own film. Marvel pat yourself on the back again, yay Girl Power and your trailblazing feminism.  That moment could’ve been so much better had they fought him and showcased their strengths, showing woman are equally good fighters to their male counterparts. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest super heroes in the whole MCU and she was probably on screen for ten minutes of the 3-hour runtime. But to literally have them come together during this massive fight for that shot is lazy filmmaking. I want one person to tell me they weren’t taken out of the film to consider all the woman were standing together. It killed the momentum in the battle. Risk and reward, Marvel/Disney usually doesn’t do well in this area. Star Wars Episode 8 was fantastic because things were at stake and viewers weren’t just given what they wanted, look at all the complaint they received for it. I really feel episode 9 will be like Endgame in that it gives viewers everything with little to no surprises. Endgame plays everything safe, even when situations are risky they are still safe. You know everything will turn out fine. Yes, there are a few deaths but nothing we weren’t expecting going in. And most of the deaths have already been reversed. Black Widow gets her own series on Disney+. The Characters, in the ten plus years and twenty plus movies, how many characters can you say have grown? Have changed with everything that has happened to them? No character has really felt or dealt with the fallout of anything that has happened to them in previous films. If they have it was for a short period of time because on the other side of the fallout the characters are right back where they started. On a side note with infinity war they finally made Thor cool. With this movie they took ten steps back and made him a dislikable character.I’ve always felt that superhero movies are only as good as their villains. (ex. Dark Knight, Spider man Homecoming) Infinity War made Thanos a great adversary with depth, he had purpose. Endgame made him a caricature of a villain we will forgot about after the credit’s role. That ending and another example of dumbing it down for audiences. The perfect ending would’ve been Steve Rogers going back in time and sitting on the park bench as an old man. Boom! there you go; the audience is smart enough to figure out what happened. Instead they drag the film for some talk between Cap and Falcon. Then they cut to show you where other characters are at and that everything will be okay. Everything is spelled out for the viewers so don’t fret we’re all in a happy place. Like my previous paragraph no one seemed to be affected by everything that happened. I could be wrong, but I guess we will see when the next phase of movies starts rolling out. Now don’t get me wrong there are moments and scenes in this movie I enjoyed. The time travel to the 70s with Cap and Iron man was great. It’s not all bad but the things I dislike are overshadowing the things I liked.The more days I sit with this film the more I dislike it and the hype machine it has become. There’s no substance to anything in this film. When I see people saying this should get nominated for an Oscar, I want people to ponder if they’ll remember anything about this movie in 10 years or even 1 year. In closing here’s one more pat on the back, congrats to the people at Marvel/Disney.",-1
"Avengers Endgame is a good movie, not without its flaws. If it weren't for the actors involved the first act would drag more than it did. Remember when Thor was not an interesting character til thor ragnorak? Well when they go back in time third personality is transmitted into the older movies which was nice. The time travel is convoluted but fun and the ending of this movie with the battle was action packed  with twists and turns. Thanks is amazing again and the ending heartbreaking.  This movie is flawed but fun",0
"Avengers Endgame is a great movie. It is a solid end to the past 11 years of great cinematic storytelling. And although I think it is a little bit overrated, I do think it is also worthy of being the closing movie for the current MCU. There is a colossal ensemble of characters that shine in each of the scenes that they are in, there are emotional moments that make you want to cry, there is lots of funny humour and tense action, it has it all. But, it can be a bit messy at points and it does have a few issues with pacing, but on the whole, a great movie and a satisfying conclusion.",1
"Avengers endgame is a really good movie with great visuals and music, but the movie have some problems, the story is not a incredible well made book, because have some fails like sometimes time travel need to be well made and not be forced to be in the movie, and people that doesn't watch the previous movies, does not understand what is happening sometimes, but is a great movie and a great present for the marvel fans",1
Avengers Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the MCU's Infinity Saga. It is the epic culmination of 22 films and it mainly doesn't disappoint. If you are a consistent Marvel fan you will find this movie simply amazing as it is very nostalgic and offers tons of fan service. Though I worry viewers who watch the movie without the context of previous films won't get it. Despite a few minor flaws like messy pacing and sometimes unnecessary humour the film is an entertaining thrill ride that will have Marvel fans invested in its interesting plot from beginning to end.,0
"Avengers Endgame is an amazing action movie and an epic ending to the saga that Marvel started 10 years ago, its a must see if you are a fan of super hero movies, action in general or you have been following this universe.",1
"Avengers Endgame is one of the very few movies that I can watch over and over again based on it's amazing story, humor and action. The final battle is the best final battle against a villain that I have seen ever. 9/10 for me.",1
"Avengers Endgame is the closing of the last 10 years of Disney supremacy in terms of super heroes. This film is not flawless. It is cool very well done with a cast of high fly. He is Tony Clack's Emblem of Robert Jr. Downey. We even have the right to Disney's vision of their work. My disappointment is in the treatment that Disney always keeps ie ""We hurry to treat the entire environment and we focus on the characters on the screen."" The strength of a Disney is the licenses so why wasted all the time. The swipe is too quickly explained. The time machine is useless since it is enough to have only the combination. The death of one of the characters for the stone of infinity is really the déjà vu which defuses all emotion before the scene. A Disney movie without real death is a disappointment because no one really dies. It's like hesitation in the life of the day it does not move anything forward.Avengers Endgame est la cloture des 10 derniéres années de suprématie de Disney en terme de super Héros. Ce film n'est pas sans faille. Il est cool trés bien fait avec un casting de haute volé. Il est l'Embléme du Tony Strack de Robert Jr Downey. Nous avons meme le droit à la vision de Disney sur leur oeuvre. Ma deception est dans le traitement que Disney garde toujours c'est a dire ""On se dépéche de traiter tout l'environnement et on se concentre sur les personnage à l'écran"". La force d'un Disney ce sont les licences alors pourquoi se dépéché tout le temps. Le swipe est trop vite expliqué. La machine à remonté dans le temps est inutile vu qu'il suffit d'avoir uniquement la combinaison. La mort d'un des personnage pour la pierre d'infinité est réeellement du déja vu ce qui désamorce tout émotion avant la scéne. Un film Disney sans réel décés c'est une déception car personne ne meurt vraiment. C'est comme hésité dans la vie de tout les jour ça ne fait rien avancer",1
"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of movies, in this vast universe of comics, as a fan since the first iron man movie, which hooked, I thought that the Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie, but Infinity War and Endgame made me To think twice, this movie is something truly epic, I had not seen something like this since the Lord of the Rings: the return of the king, and even that has plot holes, and that he makes the same mistakes as his predecessor Infinity war brothers Russo did an incredible job together with the whole cast, it's one of those movies to watch before he dies, this movie does put an ""End"" on this Infinity Saga.",1
"Avengers Endgame is the most jaw dropping movie I have ever seen. Not only because of what unfolds but really because of how it unfolds. It's not only ambitious, it has so much heart that people that haven't even connected to these characters might shed a tear over their hardships. Tony Stark was great as always, the Hulk became as likeable as ever, Black Widow shocked me, and Captain America did good. I think a real standout is Captain Marvel though. Her power was so brute that it gave me goosebumps but her vulnerability shined through and made me emotionally involved with what she was doing. Thor though... Overall I thought this movie was really worth the decade wait.",1
"Avengers Endgame is the satisfying conclusion that we could all ask for, with a ton of hype moments, sad moments, and scenes that will make you feel a sense of nostalgia. The satisfying conclusion to all these movies that we all asked for. 9/10",1
Avengers Endgame is the well-deserved end to the Avengers saga. The time travel moments are meh though and the continued joke of Thor being fat got old quick. The intellectual Hulk was nice to see and a really clever character. Iron Man being killed at the end was sad.,0
Avengers Endgame was the biggest waste of time I’ve ever spent in a movie theatre. The entire movie is boring except for about the last 20 minutes. The writing is horrible and everything is explained through pure luck and **** Sounds like they forced Thanos to lose in every possible way. Wouldn’t recommend this movie to anyone unless they wanted to see how **** a movie can still be despite having an outstandingly high budget.,-1
Avengers Endgame will go down in history as one of the best comic book films of all time. The film is both amazing fan service and a satisfying end to the MCU's long overarching plot.,1
"Avengers Endgame, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, ends the “Infinity Saga” of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a trail-blazing, wildly unpredictable manner; bringing 22 films of story to a towering, satisfying close.While the quality of MCU films have always spanned from mediocre to excellent, not even the best have  managed to break past being “really good for a superhero movies”. Luckily, Endgame finally bucks this trend.The Russos, who also directed last year’s Infinity War deserve all the recognition they can get for successfully putting a cap on 10+ years of character development in a way nobody predicted. The story is so experimental and unconventional, it was a bit unbelievable that it was a Marvel movie at times. Speaking of characters, the direction the movie takes certain heroes is incredibly shocking while never being arbitrary. Some decisions are hilarious, others are heartbreaking, but they all work incredibly well.A surprising highlight of the movie is actually Bruce Banner (aka. The Hulk). The twist that’s put on his character is not only dizzyingly hilarious, but also profoundly meaningful and, as always, the appeal of the character is helped along by a typically charismatic and likeable Mark Ruffalo performance.All performances are good, though, with Robert Downey Jr. in particular giving an incredible performance as Iron Man. With this being the finale of the saga, many actors  give incredible performances in their final appearances in the MCU.The film is far from light, though, as the latter half of the film is surprisingly gruelling; climaxing in an emotionally towering climax that is certain to please longtime fans. The film is absolutely not perfect, though, as there is a handful of uncharacteristically hamfisted moments pepper throughout; one scene in particular, which is clearly meant to be empowering, makes little sense and comes off as more pandering than anything.Also, while the film is largely entertaining, the film does feel a bit bloated at times and the surprisingly lengthy first act is incredibly slow moving and somber and is guaranteed to test some audiences’ patience.Overall, though, The MCU has pulled off something pretty amazing. It has ended 22 films of work in a way that is not only satisfying, but surprisingly experimental and groundbreaking. There is undoubtedly problems with endgame, but they are far from crippling and it’s worth marveling at what has been accomplished.",0
"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.",-1
"Avenger's to me was a great movie, here's why, Marvel Studios brought back the nostalgia feel and them going back in time made it feel like all the OG movie's in one. The comedy was perfect for me as I myself am a funny guy.(not really) I defeintly loved the conclusion's to the character's and the scene where all your favorite hero's are together.",1
"Avengers: Endgame is a fantastic and emotion conclusion to the Infinity Saga, and the beginning of the future of the MCU. Avengers: Endgame provides funny, heart-wrenching, and beautiful storytelling that's full of satisfaction. Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth are fantastic in their respective roles, and the return of Tom Holland, Tessa Thompson, Chadwick Boseman and others, is fantastic. This movie is for all to love and enjoy!",1
"Avengers: Endgame is a triumphant and emotional closure of the MCU's Infinity saga, an epic series of 22 movies starting with 2008's Iron Man. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have done a tremendous job in managing so many dozens of characters and making a great movie.Let me start with the bad news. Endgame isn't as impactful as Infinity War, because the 1st movie's Snap that erased countless living beings is about to be undone. Another reason for this is Thanos. In the 1st movie he was a perfectly balanced and well-written villain with a human side. In the latest movie he's been reduced to another blood-thirsty criminal, no different than Ronan the Accuser or Red Skull. I expected to see some more character development and backstory for Thanos, but there was none of that. Still Thanos proves to be more than a match for the heroes in combat, much more so than in Infinity War.Apart from Thanos, everything else in this movie is almost perfect. This is the culmination of 10 years and 21 MCU movies' worth of storytelling. The stakes are so high that nearly every MCU character joins the fight against Thanos' armies. I even expected to see the Kree, the Skrulls, and other cosmic beings such as Dormammu or the Celestials (it has happened in the comics) join the fight against Thanos as well because he's the biggest threat to the Universe, but I guess it would have been too much to ask for. The final battle is as chaotic as those of the Lord of the Rings or other epic blockbuster movies, with a satisfying ending nonetheless.But Endgame is not just fierce battles and non-stop violence. There is plenty of personal drama and tragedies happening, too. Characters confront their past and make amends with it. Others have to grief and keep going. But there is also tons of comedy and fun stuff, as you'd expect from an MCU movie. I could go on and on but I'd spoil things. The myriads of past comic book story references are impressive and touching.Kudos to the many actors involved. Everyone did their best job in this genre-defining movie.But most importantly, the audience in the cinema hall cheered, screamed, ""oooh""-ed and cried multiple times during the film's many important scenes. Particularly during the late Stan Lee's seemingly last ever cameo. That sense of community and ""we are in it together"" kind of feeling is not something usually found in other movies.Avengers: Endgame isn't the end for the MCU though. It's like the season finale of a TV series before the next one is broadcast later on. It's an episode where things calm down after the climax and story threads are wrapped up before the next adventure begins. The MCU will continue, but Marvel have yet to reveal their plans for the future. For now, there is the Spider-Man: Far From Home movie to wait for.",1
"Avengers: Endgame is an amazing cinematic experience. It had just enough action, it was emotional, and hilarious. My favorite action scene was the final battle. The moment the portals showed up and all the dusted Avengers came out of the portals I was hyperventilating. My favorite emotional scene would have to be Tony sacrificing himself to save millions. Thanos did not last long whatsoever in the hands of Iron Man. Finally, my favorite hilarious scene would have to be Thor taking the headset and threatening to fly to Noobslayer's house, take his arms off, and shove them up his ass. Every theory I came up with was true. I theorized that the Quantum Realm would have a role in the plot, I theorized that the dusted Avengers would come back, and I theorized that we would get Professor Hulk.    There were a few things that I didn't like much about the movie. In the beginning when Tony was sleeping on the Benatar then Captain Marvel shows up, the movie doesn't explain how she found him and Bruce Banner did not have many action scenes at all. The only action scene that I can remember was Bruce lazily acting like Hulk. Besides all my dislikes I really liked this movie. It's amazing how easy the Russo Brothers can make Box Office hits.",0
"Avengers: Endgame is dumb. Very dumb. It's a messy, convoluted time-caper strung together by cheesy one-liners, lowbrow actions, and halfwitted takes on morals, ethics, and the value we place on life. I understand that one doesn't go into a Marvel flick expecting high art, but the mass public fascination towards these characters and the esteem critics hold this film in would suggest otherwise. More to the point, I think that when you have this large of an audience, mainly of impressionable teens who are forming complex worldviews, you have a responsibility to give people something real to chew on.The actors clearly had a good time working on this picture and their acting charisma really is a force to be reckoned with. That much I'll give the movie credit for.",-1
"Avengers: Endgame is everything that Infinity War was not. It lacks a defined, meaningful, or interesting story, fails to explore new facets of any of its characters, and has a total disregard for all of the material that came before it. There's an old adage in comic books that any story that is solved with time travel is no story at all, and for Endgame this holds true.",-1
Avengers: Endgame is my new favorite movie of all time! It is just amazing!,1
Avengers: Endgame is the most satisfying conclusion possible to 11 years of built anticipation. The movie contains a fantastic balance between classic Marvel humor while making the entire audience aware of the stakes and the gravity of the situation. References to previous MCU entries are constant and emotional moments are present throughout. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.,1
"Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of 22 films that I, as well as countless others, have grown up with. This is a character film and takes a deep look at the characters that we have fallen in love with over the past eleven years. It takes its time which can affect the pacing but does it in a way where your time isn't being wasted as a viewer. Everything is important and makes the final scenes so emotional. The acting, editing, sound design, cinematography, & directing are all on their A game and it shows. While this film does have some flaws, like the previously mentioned pacing, no one can deny this is a perfect end. The last hour is some of the most satisfying and emotional scenes you'll see in any comic book film. I couldn't ask for a better send off to so many of my favorite characters!",1
"Avengers: Endgame is, and I'm not overselling this, a wonderfully crafted film that truly ends one of the best organised franchises ever. Sometimes a bit slow, sometimes a bit tóó much comic relief, and some weird decisions regarding character development, but somehow, it all works, like pieces finally fitting in a magnificent (not at all perfect, but magnificent) puzzle. The two first acts are steady and are greatly dedicated to the core characters, as the third act focuses on the ultimate fight, crafting one of the most epic shots I have ever seen in movie history, and by far my favorite shot from the entire MCU. Regarding the title, Endgame truly feels like an end, and as a rather perfect one for that matter (certainly if you're an MCU fan -- in which case you will experience what is probably the most satisfying ending of a film ever), wrapping up the entire Infinity Saga with some emotional but primarily satisfying and in a way beautiful (dare I say perfect) ending. The screenplay goes through a rough patch due to its complex story, but still manages to deliver a cohesive film. As acting performances are concerned, Downey and Evans again do whatever it takes to pull off the portryal of their legendary characters, but it is Jeremy Renner and Chris Hemsworth who are really performing like their lives depend on it. Ruffalo looks like he had the best time ever shooting this flick, while performances of Johansson and Brolin are steady as ever. As I previously stated, the ending is perfect. There is absolutely no way anyone can guess how the story goes, as Marvel is trying to be as inventive as they can. I am extremely satisfied with Avengers: Endgame, a culmination film that exceeds expectations (that were already pretty high) and that does everything it can to be as spectacular, jaw-dropping and bombastic as possible. Again, satisfying is the word. And epic. And complex. But mostly satisfying and epic.",1
"Avengers: Endgame starts off in a situation we don't often see in superhero movies; the heroes have lost. Thanos has successfully erased half of all life. When the Avengers discover that he has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent them from being used again, they eventually decide to do some time travel to get past versions of the stones in an attempt to revive everyone that disappeared.This is a film that rewards you if you've seen several past MCU films, with events of said films going on in the background as the Avengers and their allies search for the stones. The action's great, there are emotional stakes, and the humour generally hits. The directions taken with Banner/Hulk and Thor will probably rub some the wrong way, but this is ultimately a great conclusion to the ""Infinity Saga"". I can't wait to see where the MCU is taken next.",1
"Avengers: Endgame was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. While I felt it was step up from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame still disappointed me on an entertainment level. I understand that it’s really hard to live up to the massive hype and satisfy fans with a pre-written storyline, but the slow pacing of Endgame was really frustrating at times. It felt like separate movies playing out at different times, fitted into one movie. The entire first two hours didn’t really give me any surprises, although I was still entertained at times. However, the final battle in the last third of the movie was incredible and the storyline started to draw me in until the final scene. All in all, Endgame was a letdown for me, but I was still entertained for a minor part of the film. (56/100)",-1
"Avengers: Endgame. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. It takes you through a emotional rollercoaster with references sprinkled throughout, bringing you back to where it all began but has a few moments which make it just short of a 10.Captain Marvel was not needed in the movie and served as a ex machina, ruining one of the most epic scene in movie history where earth teams up to defeat thanos and destroys his spaceship in a scene that looked like a reskin of the last jedi which as we know, was not received so well. There were also some inconsistencies throughout the movie with some power scaling problems. An example is Captain America fighting past thanos and getting flung across but was able to handle his infinity gauntlet punch in infinity war? He was also able to summon mjonir because he was worthy, but if he could, why couldn't others? Thor was also seen fat but still was able to fit in his armor and time suit? I understand the material of the time suit might be flexible but armor doesn't have flexibility so we are supposed to assume he just burned fat in a day? Enough of negatives, let's get to the good parts!Throwbacks really caused me to tear up, especially the time travel back to guardians of the galaxy and original avengers as we've known them throughout all these years and movies. Humour was executed greatly in a movie with such a serious tone but worked. Occasionally throwing in jokes helps viewers recover. It is filled with fan service rewarding old fans but not alienating new fans with a simple plot and was sad to see such characters as Captain America go, seeing how they grew but passing on the torch to newcomers to the marvel franchise and I'm looking forward to see what they do next after thanos. We also continue to see the humanity of thanos and him breaking throughout the course of the MCU. We can see that he wanted to eliminate half the universe and when earth revolts, he offers a different solution but the goal stays the same, to let life live in an utopia and achieve peace which is reasonable, and how much he was willing to sacrifice, almost dying to destroy the stones themselves instead of keeping it with him as they served no purpose, showing his humanity and that he cared for people.Endgame also gave finality to the whole series when people started to say that they were the same movies over and over again and although I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from. Just hearing the theme and seeing the avengers team up for one last time was purely amazing and epic with a good ending. Having no end credit or mid credit scene might seem lazy or usual, I believe that that's intentional as they don't want it to be some opener for a bigger movie but an great end to a even greater series.Marvel, I love you 3000. 9/10",1
"Avengers:End game is by far a much better film than Infinity War. More structured and more cohesive than the mess that was IW. That being said, I think the film is a very good conclusion to the last 10 year journey, which I have been part of since watching the first Iron Man during my high school days. What I loved about the film was that it took a lot of risks and some much needed character conclusion to their arks. In a funny world, these characters would have survived indefinitely and continue to rake in millions of dollars for the Disney overlords, but I must commend Kevin Fegie, the directors and screenwriters to actually end most of their storylines. A lot of care was taken in terms of the direction of the characters and what this film would end. The meta aspects of this film was particularly satisfying with those who have followed all the films will enjoy the subversions offered throughout this 3 hour epic. That said this film is far from perfect, with many of the same flaws still very much present.First, despite its epicness, much of the films drag into 3 distinct sections that I don't think add to being a very good cinematic experience. One massive annoyance is the tonal fluctations that seem to drag this movie down much like in IW. For example, in the first Act which reflects on the aftermath of Thanos's successful plan, we get some really dramatic scenes, then suddenly we get the usual MCU exposition/comedy scenes all fitted within adjacent to one another. One moment Black widows talking about something serious, and then another character talks about peanut butter sandwhiches. This is one of the painful things about the recent MCU films is the lack of dedication to the more dramatic aspects of their situation. First act on repeat viewings would have the feeling on dragging on because pretty much no action takes place. Another problem is that despite having these character moments, I dont think the film does a good job exploring these characters properly and in fact, there is little introspective of the sitatuion. We get to see for example, Captain America talk about how to move on in some sort of help group, but then we get little world-building of the tragedy that occured during IW. One thing I keep saying is that as the MCU keeps getting bigger and expanding, the world keeps feeling smaller and indifferent. For example, where is the military, why doesnt the film show what happens to the governments in Earth and other parts, where is Thunderbolt Ross, Martin Freeman's character, what about the villains? etc. We get very little of this but only a focus on the Avengers who lets face it, don;t really do much or is needed. Another poor thing that becomes apparent with the MCU is the lack of any villains/antagonists that are developed or survive long enough to be part of this. It feels like a missed opportunity in this film to actually get a sense of a bigger world at large. The movie then becomes a time travel/heist movie that is actually the most enjoyable. Despite some nitpicky time travel issues, I think this part was the most interesting and definitely the most worth in repeat viewings. However, this again was not a lot of actions and the characters splitting up made only some duos more interesting (ie Cap and Iron Man), whereas the pair of Black Widow/Hawkeye & WarMachine/Nebula were definitely boring and generic. There is also a lot of conveniences in this film which becomes more noticable on repeat viewings. The final act, is a massive fight and deeply rewarding on an action perspective. Whilst it is good, its certainly still not as good as the Russo's brothers previous efforts. WE get glimpses of all the good characters fighting and there are some genuinely jaw dropping moments such as Captain America picking up Mjolinir and the avengers assembling for the final fight. Lots of CGI which is a mix big unfortunately.That being said, this was a much enjoyable film. The mixed feeling/score is reflective on the lack of cinematic quality and annoyance in that the film does many good stuff, but then is let down on other crucial aspects. Other things such as handing the mantle to Falcon, lack of emotional scene for Black Widow become bug bears on repeat viewings. Overall, this was still a satisfying experience, but for the sake of MCU, I hope they improve on the story and characters more in the future endeavours and be more like Winter Soldier, First Iron Man and Civil War which I think still are their best films.",-1
"Avengers:End Game provides an entertaining climax to the current generation of Marvel Super hero films however, like Hawkeye and Black Widow at Vormir, it came pretty close to falling from the cliff and failing the mission in a few places, but thankfully crisp (not rushed) pacing provided a life-line whenever we were staring into the abyss.We begin with a continuation of the gloom cast by the end of Infinity War, and are invited to a heartbreaking picnic with Hawkeye, this scene is played well; not overdone. It is sad and reminds us of what has been at stake, and the recent defeat of the Avengers. It sets the tone for the film nicely; we are going to have to confront the emotional debris left in Thanos' wake over the course of the next few hours. We settle in for the ride.The only problem with the picnic scene is it happens during the day, while over in Wakanda...presumably simultaneously, it was also daytime. I suppose we can just re-imagine Hawkeye's farm was in Africa. But it certainly looks more likely a good scene was developed and shot without much thought going on regarding the time-line of events. Which is strange, because as the film goes on. Time becomes a central issue.Stark is rescued,avoiding certain death twice in the space of a few days now...he returns bitter and damaged, as are all our heroes. We go after Thanos then take a break for 5 years.Thor is suffering PTSD. As a big fan of The Big Lewbowski,I enjoyed his transformation here, but had some horrible Luke Skywalker flashbacks, which I think are the main trigger from some of the outrage on-line at this decision. I think it works here, because Marvel has always had a comedic element. Thor had a compelling reason to be in the state he was in, and the writers allow us to see him rise from the ashes of himself again as the final battle looms.Once the time travel story begins, we came close to the fall. The constant referencing of films (as with Spiderman in Infinity war referencing the Alien franchise) and revisiting scenes from previous films seemed to bog the story down. Rather than making me feel connected to these characters because of their familiarity with the actual world, I felt pulled out of the fantasy...the effect was to break the fourth wall and rather than finding it charming I felt it broke immersion. Despite this being essentially a fun entertainment piece I hate it when immersion gets broken and I'm forced to realize I'm in a room full of people I don't know, (despite the enjoyment of the shared experience of watching a film in a theater),I came here to escape all these people for a few hours. Luckily, the time travel sequences are handled briskly, and are used to set up some nice moments with Captain America (which pays off nicely at the end) the Tony, Mr Stark, Jarvis triangle and then Thor with his mother.My only disappointment with the film is the transformation of Thanos (or regression?).He was a mystery for so long, and then his motivation and cold logic were one of the best things about Infinity War. His personal sacrifice and strength of will to persevere toward his goal, were terrifying and unique. Unfortunately, here we take a turn, and his philosophy is reduced to a simple desire to destroy all life, and remake the world(s) in his own image. Oh...this interesting and complex villain is now just a regular Bad Guy. Let's just all beat each other up now.The climactic fight is spectacular, there is a sense of real peril for most of our heroes and the film manages to keep us on edge. There are a few cringe moments, but again it's a subjective and personal question of taste, little things that don't really damage the film but we could have done without.Captain Marvel again giving us an unwelcome Last Jedi Flashback, flying though Thanos's spaceship in a reflection of the Last Jedi Light-speed ram.In the midst of battle, everything pauses conveniently as a few reunions take place, the whole Grrrl squad moment was a cringe, but thankfully they moved on quickly and didn't make too much of a deal about it.Jump to the final moment of the battle and here comes the coup de grace..'I am....Iron man'. Now that moment was excellent, and was worth sacrificing the Thor 'I went for the head' climax by positioning that as a surprise at the start of the film. We got the best of both worlds there.So in conclusion. A worthy part 2 to Infinity War, which was a very hard act to follow, let alone to try and top. The film looks beautiful, the action sequences are easy to follow and mostly avoid 'shaky cam'. A sad but satisfying end for Iron man; his heroes journey is complete. Having grown from self centered to self sacrificing over the course of the films. Captain America says farewell and his decision was logical and consistent to his desires, and Thor seems a great fit for the Guardians of the Galaxy.I look forward to watching Infinity War and End Game back to back in a marathon someday soon.",1
"Avengers:Endgame historic performanceThis review was never about whether one should see this movie or how much money to spend. Standard, 3D, IMAX, or 4D, no matter how you see this movie it will be worth the money, regardless of whether you are a true fan or from the general population. This was further confirmed when all movie tickets were sold out 3 weeks prior to the opening weekend. But let’s talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heros, villians, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we’ve all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional rollercoaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn’t even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spiderman: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility.",1
"Avengers:Endgame is the culmination of over a decade of work, and while that is admirable (and I have enjoyed it thoroughly for the most part) Endgame felt to me like every one wanted to stand around and part themselves on the back for 3 hours.There were parts of genuine emotion, humor and tragedy, but it really felt like Disney were saying 'Goodbye' to an older product line and 'Hello' to new planks in the franchise building model.I guess we will never know what the Russo brothers could have done if Disney had taken the handcuffs off - they were brilliant in The Winter Soldier - because the movie spent so long establishing new settings and characters for the next phase of the MCU.  New Captain America, Loki disappears with the Tessaract, the Asgardians of the Galaxy, Gentle Hulk ... everywhere you look there is a new movie in the works.  Disney has shown a shocking lack of awareness when it comes to their cash cows - they managed to torpedo the Star Wars franchise after couple of movies - and it looks like they won't be stopping any time soon with the MCU, Black Widow, Gaurdians 3, Spiderman:Far From Home all the works and the feeling of franchise fatigue is well and truly settling in.The movie itself isn't terrible.  It has some really good parts, but it's just kind of a mess.  It flips from tragic, to heroic, to suspense without really knowing if the emotions have landed, or if you even care.  Thor going back and having a moment with his mother is a scene with genuine emotion, then having Hulk and Black Widow barely acknowledge each other in the aftermath of the dusting is completely ridiculous (remember when they were an item? What the hell happened to that? Wouldn't a galaxy spanning tragedy pull the survivors closer together?)  Ugh, it's a series of moments stitched together to create a spectacle but it doesn't really make for a great viewing experience.  Speaking of viewing - did it feel to anyone else that they kind of got to the end of production, saw some of the CGI and went ""Eh, that'll do""?  Because there are scenes that are jarring in the uneven production values of the imagery.  Most scenes are done well, but there is the odd scene where it is really noticeable that they haven't brought their A game.After the initial adrenaline rush of viewing it for the first time, I was struck by how disappointed I felt in the movie.  It had all the elements of a great movie, and yet seemed to be a bit tone deaf in the execution.  And after all the crashing and exploding were finished, the Russo's went full Peter Jackson and spent half an hour at the end giving every character full fan service (complete with nameplate and signatures in the credits).  They should have called the movie Avengers: Curtain Call, and it would have been more appropriate.The one thing it does do is create an end.  Stark sacrificing himself for the greater good sees the full character arc of Tony complete.  He was the first, and most important, Avenger and the MCU won't be the same without him.  (Note: With the introduction of Time travel, it's not like they're just gonna let him stay dead if the box office starts to suffer).So if you're invested in the series, go see it.  It's not for you if you haven't been keeping up with the movies though, as the movie expects you to have a pretty thorough knowledge of the happenings in the MCU up to this point.Welcome to the MCU, where the characters are made up and the plot doesn't matter.",-1
Awesome Movie!! I'm not going to spoil it for anyone. This is a must see. Action packed and a tear jerker all in one!There is so much here especially if youve ever been a fan of the comics of just watched the MCU movies!,1

Best marvel movie ever. This took 10 years to be set up and it was worth it.,1
"best marvel movie to date!!!!can't say much with spoiling so I will keep it short. I was absolutely stunned by the movie. Last year I thought infinity war would be my favorite mcu movie but it ended up taking the number 3 spot. This time I thought I should wait until declaring it the best in a long series of amazing movies, but halfway through the movie I said there's no way by the end of the movie It's not my favorite marvel movie.Marvel went balls to the walls, throwing everything they had creatively and successfully doing so. the amount of good fan service was unbelievable, and compared to such a complicated plot they stuck the landing. most importantly the movie has a lot of heart, finishing a 22 movies, 11 years in the making, epic storyline, with a lot of feelings and emotions. Joy, sadness, laughter, sorrow, dread, It had it all. If you haven't seen it already why are you still reading this, go to the cinema right now!!!!!!!!!!!!Whatever it takes!",1
best movie ever from 2019 along with toy story 4! the characters are awesome (except the villains) the whole plot is amazing! i call this the best movie ever from 2019 along with toy story 4!,1
Best movie ever. Fat Thor is the best scene. This movie is so hilarious and entertaining. Perfect end to the Infinity Saga of the MCU.,1

Boring no good humor they f*cked up Thor by being so funny to make him fat hahaha,-1
"Boring, long and far below expectation after the great movie infinity war. First two hours trying to explain crazy time travel theories. Last hour, with more action, nonsense dialogues, dark battles and low impact after return of heroes previously swept. Didn´t like it.",-1
"Boring, predictable, not intense, wanted to sleep many times during this unnecessary 3 hours of lame dialogs.Feminism is a crucial part of Hollywood, so of course there are some scenes just about that, it isn't so bad. BUT! Captain Marvel ruins any common sense and conflict in story, if there were no other characters the final wouldn't really change, because there is nothing that she couldn't do just by herself. There cannot be any good story in the universe where 1 character could potentially solve all the problems, but this character doesn't do it for no reason whatsoever.",-1
"Boring, trunkated characters, plotholes, stupid story, badly managed drama. Way to long... All events are predicted from A:IF easily, no surprises. Worst possible ending of the saga. Goodby my dreams of an epic conclusion. And a last question... How can universe can still exist if the one that make it like this disapear before doing it ? Storytelling noobs... Stop ruining my childhood superheroes...",-1
"Boring. CGI overused. Yuck. Half of the movie, I'm slept. Ugly storyline. Biggest Disappointment.",-1
"Characters:Pushed an agenda with Brie LarsonCaptain Marvel ruins the only good scenes in the movie and also could have easily shortened it by a whole hour. The Hulk/ Bruce Banner's character arc was absent from the film. There is nothing of the Hulks character arc except that Bruce Banner got at peace with the Hulk and now is professor Hulk for some reason.Thor 's character was completely butchered. In the beginning of the movie he was silent, then suddenly has a random outburst and kills Thanos, afterwards in the future becomes a fat drunker that plays Fortnite all day. Not to mention that he stays this way for the rest of the film. This happening to the Thor, such a well built up character (besides Thor Dark World) is very disappointing to see. Especially since Thor was built up in Ragnorock and very crucial in Infinity War. His character ending up like this and the audience knowing he is stuck like this forever is very saddening. Loki, Heimdall, and the dead asguardians don't feel avenged.Iron man in space was major waste of time since the audience know his dragged out death scene on the Malano is for nothing. The audience know Iron man isn't going to die in space so having him sleep there like he is, is just a huge waste of time. To make this worse, instead of having Tony Stark and Nebula. A character is who is also stranded in space with him come up with a great plan to fix the ship so that they can get back to Earth. All they do is have the Mary Sue, Captain Marvel. Come out of nowhere, save them, and carry their ship back safely to Earth. This shows the viewer that there is only an agenda of feminism being shoved at them to love Captain Marvel. Tony Stark, who is one of the smartest characters in the MCU get saved like this. Whether it may have been a man or a woman makes no sense. There was no reason for him to be in space if he was just going to get rescued.Thanos, which was remarkably the best MCU villain to date was COMPLETELY ruined by bad writing. Since the first Avengers back in 2012 we get to see hints to Thanos and how powerful he is. Him sending the Chitari to New York, killing billions of people across the Universe, stealing Nebula from her parents, wanting all the stones for power, ect. In this movie when he was introduced everyone was hoping for the mad titan to be ready for them and have an epic battle but no. All we got was him getting ambushed, not prepared, and getting decapitated in once slice. This made the audience feel sorry for a Thanos. A being of immeasurable power and strength instead of feared. Now instead of the Avengers who easily killed Thanos, having a villain to fight. It left the audience thinking of only two options.  Having another villain to fight or going back in time fight a younger Thanos but still kill him easily since this one died with one attack.In the end fight scene when Captain Marvel comes in from who knows where. She end up pulling a Kirby from Brawl flying straight through Thanos' ship blowing up the whole thing, killing his army, and almost killing him. Of course Thanos' on the spot thinks of using the power stone to punch Captain Marvel away. They could never have Captain Marvel kill him because all the fans would riot after the movie especially since they Disney knows nobody likes her.Tone:The movies tone was all over the place. At times it would get sad and then suddenly hit you with a really bad joke(out of place comedy).Since the movie started off with a very sad tone once they started adding in comedy it took away the dramatic effect of the eventsThe movie was set up to be a dark film but had many ridiculous jokes and was very all over the placeOthers:Not a good finale for an 11 year build up and 45+ hours worth of filmsTime travel doesn't make much sense. Supposedly whatever is done in the past is its own universe and even if they change events in the past nothing changes in the future. Captain Marvel getting attacked by Thanos without the power stone and not taking any damage or flinching confirmed that she is a Mary Sue. Hulk getting the same amount of burns as Iron man make no sense.Thor is nerved to much even with both hammers.Even thought Banner is professor Hulk he never actually fights.Thor leaves his people for the Gaurdians of the Galaxy because reasons?Female super hero moment feminism is extremely obvious and very awkward.Doctor Strange is wasted and does nothing but transport everyone to the battlefield.Much longer than it needed to be.",-1
"Clown fiesta.The movie broke its own fundamental rules,a rush end to a very successful series of movies.Plot holes cause of bad and lazy scenario.In every Marvel movie so far,you could feel the love for the universe.In Endgame all you feel is a ""let's fill 3 hours and get over with this **** already.Let's just take their money"".If Stan Lee was alive he would be sad.Avengers Endgame should be renamed into Ticket Heist.I wish I could give a - grade,0 is honestly too much",-1
"Coming as one of the biggest conclusion in the cinematic history, Avengers: Endgame lives up of its name as the most satisfying, story-wrapping epic of it's own kind.",1
"Complete mess, shoehorned everything but the kitchen sink, and destroyed a golden path laid out by Infinity War, bits were really good but over all it is nothing but a word minced maze of lack of imaginations colliding. Been marvel my whole life, and now with this i am not. Thanks for nothing.",-1
"Completely impossible to follow plot line, sound level fluctuations in the movie made it horrible to sit through.",-1
"Considering how much I enjoyed Infinity War, I was surprised by how disappointing Endgame was.  Not a bad movie by far, and some of the things that bothered me won't be an issue for others, but I expected more.  With that said, the beginning and ending are the best parts, so you'll likely leave the theatre happy (even if the movie doesn't sit too well as you digest it).I was surprised by the amount of humor.  And even though I thought the jokes mostly landed, it was weird that in a universe where half of sentient life disappeared there are so many people cracking jokes.  I would have appreciated a darker humor until the snap is reversed.  I just felt it undercut the stakes and loss the characters would be feeling after their defeat in the last movie, even if a bit of levity is needed for the audience's sake.The thing that bothered me the most was the reliance of time travel as a plot device.  I can accept time travel if it's just kind of in the background, but the moment a movie tries to make it seem real is the moment I can't accept it anymore.  The worst part of Endgame is that despite telling myself several times, ""Just ignore it and have fun!"" the movie spends a lot of screen time on the time travel plot and is constantly trying to justify it.  In the end I couldn't get past it and it made the middle of the movie really sag.",-1
"Contains essentially what JUSTICE LEAGUE (even the dreadful, Warner's-mangled first version) does, and with the same bombast Zack Snyder has (sometimes quite fairly) been accused of.  Overstuffed with Marvel's crew to the point where the individualism the brand has been lauded for is all but lost, the final battle seems stretched and inconsequential.  Any comparison with Snyder's corrected version of HIS apocalyptic showdown will show (as it has ever since DC learned--yes, largely from Marvel--that character is the key to storytelling), just how shallow Endgame really is.",-1
"Crazy disappointing is probably the best way I can describe this movie. I feel like giving it a 2, but to be fair a 6 is probably what it deserves. The reason I feel like giving this movie such a low score is because it was so hyped for so long building anticipation and then totally mailing it in. I admit I am a huge comic book fan and because of this I have seen every MCU movies with the exception of only making it about 75% of the way through Captain Marvel. I have become much more lenient on expecting movies to follow comic book plots and even encouraged change if I thought it was for the better. In this case they had a perfect example to adapt from in Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series. I already knew from the first part IW and due to contractual obligations these movies would be much different from the comics, but I was not expecting this. This movie throws away all the awesome scenes from the comic to replace them with lame callbacks to old movies, dragging characters through the mud like Thor and Hulk and setting things up for the ANAD Marvel characters in the future which are the worst of all the comic characters (Thanks Disney). The time travel plot was lame poorly executed and riddled this thing with plot holes. Most of the movie was boring and I felt no emotional investment. Characters I have loved fro more than 20 years died or had their final big moments in this film and I felt nothing because it was so poorly executed. I am not arrogant enough as a comic book fan to say I will never watch another MCU movie again with some of my favorite characters like Doctor Doom and the X-men joining, but I plan on skipping a lot of these until they prove to me they have their **** together.",-1
"Definitely not as interesting as Infinity War.  And while I like long movies, I only like them if I like them, and this was long and boring.  It was ""okay.""  Anti-climactic at best.  Oh well.",-1
"Delivers.Endgame is the epic conclusion to the battle against Thanks we were promised. An emotional conflict that sees The Avengers going from broken and forlorn, to reflexive, to strong again and everything in between. The power of seeing these characters go through this journey is the heart and soul of the movie, and is not to be under estimated. The majority of the three hour running time forsakes action to explore the effects Infinity War had on who these heroes have become, and yet it's no less exciting than anything that's come before.Some necessary, if minor improvements have been made that will help the MCU moving forward should Disney and Marvel stand firm in retaining this level of quality in future endeavors. For example, I've complained about subpar CGI in quite a few of these movies that seems to arise from a lack of effort being put in, rather than budgetary constraints. Here though there's not a lackluster visual to be found. I understand they realized the need to pull out all of the stops for this one and therefore phoned nothing in. A mentality that should be applied to every MCU film going forward.Brie Larson also improves in her role as Captain Marvel. She doesn't have much screen time at all, but what few scenes she does have show much more natural her performance is this time around. I'm beginning to retroactively feel that my issues with her acting in the standalone movie were more the result of the directors as opposed to the actress herself. The character of Danvers herself though could probably still use a little tweaking to make her likable though.Endgame also deals with darker content than one would expect from a MCU flick. On top of dealing with themes of hopelessness and regret stemming from how The Avengers defeat led to the deaths of so many, the violence is also quite shocking for a film of this nature. There's a decapitation right at the start of the movie and a perfectly visible slit throat for audiences to gawk at, among other bloody scenes. It's interesting to see stuff like this given the relatively wholesome nature these films have been known for and I'm curious to see what kind of content this opens the MCU on the big-screen up to in the future (they've been doing more graphic stuff like this on the television tie-ins for a while now).A lot of this movie is going to mean nothing to those who haven't followed this journey across the other 20 or so films that came before it. You might still get some entertainment from the humor and spectacle, but will be totally lost on who these people are, what's going on, and miss out on the real impact of Endgame. This is for the fans. For them it's an ending and a new beginning for a world they've been following for years now. With events that radically and forever change the face of cinema's first shared universe.9.3/10",1
"Despite its lengthy runtime, the first act feels very rushed, as a few significant character arcs don't the appropriate attention, and a few of the plot points are too straightforward. However, a great finale and an emotional conclusion, not to mention great acting and the humor that has become standard in Marvel movies, come together to bring the most ambitious event in cinematic history to a fitting and satisfying close.",0
"Despite suffering from some plot holes, Endgame is a delightful conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It has an abundance of enjoyable humor, delightful nostalgic moments, and endearing fan service. Some of time travel material made little sense, but it didn't take away from the movie's enjoyment. Endgame provides solid closure to the stories of the many characters who you've become familiar with during the last decade, while also successfully setting the stage for the next phase of MCU movies.",1
"Disappointed in the route they chose to go with this movie. Infinity War was a masterpiece that fully developed Thanos as the Mad Titan. With him beating down the Hulk, Thor, and killing Loki in the opening scene the stage is set that this is a real villain. He completed his mission beat the avengers and obtained the stones which he used to kill half of the universe. He even sacrificed his daughter in the process. All this leads into Endgame where he is easily killed  with not much of a fight in the first 20 minutes and has destroyed the stones he has worked so hard to get. It makes no sense. So instead of a movie that builds up to the defeat of Thanos and the team finding some way to bring back the others we are left with a cheap time travel plot. This was brought into the movie to give the audience a trip down memory lane revisiting old movies and for no other reason. The visuals are great as always just sucks they took what could of been an epic conclusion and turned into a popcorn flick with forced fan service forced emotional scenes and forced bad humor. This movie lacks the suspense, tension, pace, that Infinity War mastered.",0
"disappointed, overhyped, brazilian drama, indian watching time, not fun like modern allstar nba game.",-1
"Disappointing. Movie ruined all the original characters, and 3 hours was not necessary (and don't bother sitting through the end credits to hear an audio clip).Black Widow was a bad-ass in all the movies,yet, they made her character teary-eyed and overly emotional in almost every scene. and she had no real fight scenes? What? And she wasn't even given a decent death scene, just drop to your death.Captain America - giving up the shield so easily, it's like a slap in our face that he regretted being Cap America -- and wait, how was he able to stay in the past. That would mean there were 2 Steve Rogers in that timeline. And why couldn't he tell Falcon, who's he married to. Duh, we ALL know. And what?? He was able to get Thor's hammer. NO way.Thor - another character, he was bad-ass in all other movies, then reduced in this movie as drunk, emotional idiot and renounced his ""throne"" because he's not a Leader. What?Hulk - he's suppose to be a genius too but this time he couldn't figure out Quantum Physics. But Scott Lang had the idea? AH?? What???Clint - all of sudden a murderer (of criminals) and he was able to take down cartels on his own? hmmm.. really?Fury and Hill - were reduced to cameo appearances.. UGH. Horrible.The only character that stayed true was Tony Stark. His actions and dialogue made sense, and his death made sense too. This was suppose to be a comic book movie, not a bad soap opera or scifi movie.",-1
Disappointing. The build up was slow and even got boring at times. The movie was enjoyable but not great. Not sure what others found great in this movie. Definitely not my favourite avengers movie,-1
"Disclosure: I'm NOT a Marvel superfan, but I've seen all the movies, starting with Iron Man (actually, starting with Howard the Duck), and I was starting to get tired of these. However, this is a really good movie. A little bloated at 3 hours, yes, and it takes almost a full hour to really kick into gear, but they writers/director do an excellent job wrapping things up.  Some truly touching moments, and some extremely funny moments.  (""Hello Jeff Lebowsky!"") I though Capt. Marvel was given a short shrift, but I suppose that makes sense given her late entry in the series in general.  Clearly, we're not going to be seeing certain character(s) after this film, but I think it's deftly handled for maximum emotional payoff.  In my theater, there were belly laughs, cheers, and ugly cries.  Can't expect much more than that in a big budget flick, huh?",1
"Do yourself two favors before watching Avengers: Endgame.One: watch the other MCU films, or use the (not recommended) Lazy Man's Cheat Code and read the synopsis of each.Two: Do not expect the same level of character development world building from Endgame as past MCU films. (Character development is not the same as character arc completion).I was bothered when I walked out of Endgame last night without the feeling of catharsis that I expected. It did not feel as fresh and invigorating as movies before it—even its predecessor Infinity War breathed more new life into me. I went into expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and that is where I went wrong. Making the ""Greatest Movie of [variable time frame here]"" was never the Russo Brothers' intention. With 22 films preceding this one, there are plenty of moments of cinematic greatness, ESPECIALLY amongst the movies in Phase III. Endgame is not a masterpiece. But it IS a love letter to every fan who was grown with the characters, whether they've been along for the ride since '08 or found themselves binge watching each film in the weeks before its release. Don't expect a movie that ascends to new heights in filmmaking, and DEFINITELY don't watch this movie without being caught up on what happens before it. The Russo Brothers wanted to give fans one last exciting, action packed, heartbreaking, and comforting ""THANK YOU,"" and they achieved just that.",1
"Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes.",1
"Don't be fooled by all the one-review account 10-scores, there was probably some sort of prize to be won if they gave this movie a 10. The truth is that the first hour of this movie is plain boring, I mean really boring. After half an hour it becomes clear that time travel is the way to go to set things right. Can you say major plot holes on the way? Presposterous plot followed by an hour of messy crap before they get into any kind of action. The ""comedy"" is sort of on par with Infinity War. More slapstick for those who enjoy that kind of thing. Chuckles here and there and thankfully not as awkwardly childish as Ragnarok.The war scenes were good, I mean really good. Thanos is nicely done again and the fights are really well done, as we've come to expect really even if deja-vu creeps into the picture more than once. A whole lot of things still don't make any sort of sense. Captain Marvel was pushed in there with twice the charisma compared to the movie with her name on it, but that's not really that big of an achievement. Not that those good scenes are an excuse to have to sit through three hours of movie. They could have easily taken off half an hour to an hour and simply have created a better experience. It's really just too long for what it's bringing to the table.Some characters retire and some die, that's something in the sense of closure for the MCU and things to come. It could have been worse I suppose but boredom was the real winner in the end. I was really glad to get out the theatre and that's not a good sign at all.Still it's not all bad, just slow, dumb and messy before they get to the sorta good stuff. The good stuff is really good, there's just not enough of it to go around.",-1
"Don't let that 8 scare you, Avengers: Endgame is by far the most ambitious film of all time and a very important film as no other films cannot create such a big franchise.Endgame is funny, depressing, satisfying and very enjoyable and everyone gave their all (for one) in this film as some actor/actress will probably never return for the MCU after this film. There were a lot of easter eggs from this movie which links to the other films in this universal which was awesome to hear especially at the end. Everyone has a good reason why they make these decisions and doesn't leave the viewer confused. Overall, the action scenes were satisfying and awesome, the ending was a great conclusion to this movie and just in general, this was (almost) the perfect marvel movie and it's definitely worth your 3 hours of lifeThe reason I said almost is because of these reasons:1. Captain Marvel was barely in the movie, they made an entire movie about her and yet you didn't really need to watch it for Endgame as she's rarely in it and she was in the climax of the movie. Plus Brie Larson was horrible in this film and I know that she is a fantastic actress which disappoints me even further2. The movie is funny. Maybe too funny. There are so many emotional scenes in this film but then they quack a few jokes in there which sure they're funny but it destroys the flow of some tear-jerker moments3. Speaking of the flow, when they finish a dark, miserable scene, they immediately go to a bright, happy scene which just confuses me. Why could they just slowly tune down the darker scene and slowly build up into a relatively happy scene?    However, with all the negatives, I will probably rewatch this movie again",1
"Drab, predictable, boring. This movie was dragged out too long to make sure all of its stars had screen time and that made it unbearable to watch.",-1

This is not your standard superhero flick, no Endgame is more about loss, love, relations, family and just appreciating what you have.I absolutely loved all the funny references to other Marvel movies, and the jokes regarding time travel are hilarious. There are countless references and my favorite is the Coen reference to Thors new appearance.A worthy finale to a journey more than 10 years in the making.Must see if you like Marvel.",1
"ENDGAME definitely succeeds as a celebration of 11 years of the MCU, but didn't quite work for me as a movie in itself.  I certainly didn't hate it, but came away a little nonplussed with the story.  However, a couple of hours afterwards, I decided I was OK with what they did.  Somewhat tellingly, I shed not a single tear... and I am usually an easy mark when it come to ""kicks to the feelz"".  Some great bits. Some bits that felt like they dragged, but overall a triumph in terms of handling a large cast of characters and tying up 11 year old plotlines.",0
Endgame delivers despite the audience knowing where things are headed. What will be tough to endure is a MCU where key characters may not be around because of events within Endgame. This movie is special and while it's not perfect it definitely delivered for me even though I expected plenty from it and awaited eagerly for it's eventual release.,1

Emotiva y épica a parte iguales la cinta dirigida por los hermanos Russo logra en su mayor parte lo que se le pedía con una despedida a la altura para los personajes principales de la saga y para el Universo Marvel, pero a la vez decepciona en algunos aspectos que provocan que no sea un cierre totalmente satisfactorio de lo visto en estos 11 años.",1
Endgame is a good ending for IW. The story starts really slow. Mainly because you have a lot to carry over from other movies. The story is kind of grounded and didn't resolve on a magical solution that much. The acting was really solid. The FX still amazing. What they did with Thor and Banner can be debatable but I found it justified in their own ways. The final battle was something for the eyes. I found interesting that there were still consequences to the choices they made. I give it a 78%. I wasn't blown away by the movie but very satisfied with the story in general.,1
"EndGame is a great movie that, even with some plot holes and some minutiae, is a perfect ending to the Infinite Saga.",1
"Endgame is a mess. The only positive things that I have to say is the character development, I only like the the character development because of the fact about how many people they have to remember. Now the negative stuff. Let's start off with thor, Thor was so poorly written when he didnt kill thanks who should've been more to determined to fight back instead of being that fat slob we got to know, He should have been motivated to fight back. Black widow. Here is a bit more respect to marvel most of the time I think black widow is wasted but in endgame she had a decent role before she died. Professor hulk,  professor hulk was a nerdy mess the cgi at some points almost made me puke. The pacing was okay, but now the big daddy the plot holes. The plot holes were almost as bad as the ones in captain Marvel here are some I found in the first 30 minutes. Endgame Plot Holes why would fury still be holding on to that pager after 20 yearsHow did the avengers find the pager and bring it back to the compoundPeter quill ship does have a transponder the avengers would recognizeAlso captain marvel doesn't have anything to track a signalWhen a ship runs out of fuel it doesn't just stop it keeps its momentum and keeps going and eventually slows downHow does captain marvel talk and breath in space and survive the vacuum without imploding but in captain marvel she needed a helmetHow did she bring iron man and nebula down to earthNebula when she gets back says she knows thanos s whereabouts but her and Tony have been on the spaceship for weeks and tony told steve he knows nothing Conclusion endgame got a solid 5.",-1

"Endgame was a frustrating film for me to review, Because on one hand I was mindblown by the sheer force of this film. While, it is a satisfying conclusion to the stories of Iron-Man, Captain America and a few others; you can't help but get confused by the convoluted and overthought time-heist middle of the film. It's not as good as Infinity Wars it still provides a ton of emotionally satisfying moments that should please longtime fans of the series.",1
"Endgame was a major disappointment. Long overly drawn out tear jerking scenes mixed up with weak humor, plot holes and too few fight scenes plagued with very inconsistent power levels.Not to speak of what they did to many of the characters which can hardly be recognized (this goes beyond a certain Asgardian).Despite the overly long running time the movie fails to give many important characters sufficient screen time. The plot is extremely thin and telegraphed providing little tension or suspense except the in last 20 minutes.TL;DR Endgame is too long a movie trying to mix drama and superhero humor, with poor results. This movie can't hold a candle to its predecessor infinity wars.",-1

Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie.",1
Expected ending....mixed storyline without proper starting and ending character stories...and what the hell captain marvel did ,-1
Extremely overhyped for no reason i suspect Disney paid reviewers to give good scores. Plot holes were everywhere and half of the movie was chit-chat and weird mix of drama and comedy. At the end it felt like a cheesy movie made for teenagers i was not impressed,-1
F**king Awesome. Iron man is just so awesome. Captain America was overplayed a little. I felt they didn't do Thor proper justice.,1
"Fantastic movie. The first half was pretty boring however. They spent way too much time on how the Avengers reacted to the deaths of everyone. The second half was great. The action was great and the emotional scenes hit hard. There was only one cringy scene in the movie and that's where all the female heroes moved in front of Spiderman and it panned around to look at them. I thought that was unnecessary. Overall, great movie and would highly recommend it.",1
"Fascinating timeline despite mentioning previous MCUs storyline all together in one single movie without any plot holes, the 3 hours runtime doesn't feel so long due to its suspense story, there is funny moment, epic moment and the most important one..........

"Feige is done with his first arc and so are we, this is more a palette clenser than a tease, bring it more, it is simply ""old style"" good.Avengers: EndgameRusso Brothers docks the universe in one colossal stage where our mighty heroes dances the dance of their life, it is extremely well choreographed. Never has this ever pulled off at such scale, claims Marvel, and Feige proves it, by swooping in every last drop of blood shed in this war. But mind you, it is unlike Infinity War, it never gets too much. There is a certain amount of linearity in their narration that is more focused and polished than the previous installment. It is the ultimate heist, in a sense that it is as big an ambition as the cast is. And so is the storytelling, as rich as the banner goes, the usual baggage of levity that Marvel often failed to own it, comes in natural in here.Split into three acts, this wallop of emotional drama is not the tease for the game but the journey, that Robert Downey Jr. quotes to be proud of. The world of Russo Brothers, is perfectly balanced as Josh Brolin, wanted it to be. What could have been precarious is somehow its best asset, the film is obvious or even obliged to connect the dots. And as much as you feel overridden in this ride, it never grows dull; this overwhelming experience is plastered across the screen for three straight hours that is ought to make the fans giddy up for more.What has been fascinating, is to see, not Thanos turned into a mere pawn of the game, his malleable philosophy is still threatening to the leftover superheroes. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the screenwriters, are free from the stereotypical MCU formulaic structure, it doesn't tap on- a joke, an emotional punch and an actual punch- to the safe beat, they have deconstructed their rhythm for the Endgame, tears are expected, satisfaction; a surprise package.",1

From what i understood, only half of the living beeings was anihilated, so why in this movie, Earth looks deserted, like it was ninety percent? The rest of the movie was just meh.

First movie I have ever given a 10 for and it is well deserved. After 3 screenings I still cannot get enough of it. A must watch.,1
First of all the story is really boring. There are many scenes where u fallasleep. Also ironman and nebula rescue part is so weird and too fast and not explained well like they were in a hurry to make a short scene that they have been saved by Cpt Marvel. Really badly designed scene. Also no view about the civillians how they feel about their lost friends or families. Nothing we get only view from the avengers and only Earth. Another thing is that where Scott comes out from the quantum realm becuz this scene so fast and really not explained in any way. I know its a 3 hours long movie but sometimes if u cut the boring parts and replace with important part them everything will be okay. So the time travelling is a thing in many movies to fix a movie becuz the directors stupid to make a good movie. Now they split up to 3 groups to get the stones from the past but the biggest joke is they didnt try to get all from one time like before thanos snap. Thanos against thor surprise is really strong becuz he can kill Thanos. Why not travel back cut his arm and take the stones go back and thats all. But they choose the worst part to get the stones from the wrpng and complicated way. Also Thanos wasnt that great villain and the story badly explained about him the comics were way mich better than this idea. They used the bad time travel idea to kill Romanov. Also they use the stones in the end to kill tony stark. When Captain Marvel get the stones and able to snap and kill the villain but not she has a too stupid character. Also this movie killed 3 main characters to give it to the next generation and Captain Marvel character was so bad before and she will ruin the MCU and the others not enough good. Sorry Marvel thats not enough to be worthy like the comics. We got some villains and needed to kill 3 characters read the comics and checkout how many villains are there. Many acting were so bad sometimes they are forced ina scene to be there but totally not exist there.,-1
"First of all, let me state the fact that whoever embraces time travel in movie/TV/video game plots, needs to up his standards. It is one of the laziest and most uninspiring attempts to create stories around and usually ends up in not making any sense (just like in this movie).As for the film itself, it started great by showing everyone's pain and anger towards Thanos, but from the moment that mouse(lol) happens to press a button and create this whole ""time travel"" plot, everything goes to absolute **** And it's not just the time traveling, it's also the disrespect shown to characters like The Hulk and Thor, as well as the Shonen anime type of ass pulls like Captain America fighting with Thor's hammer and summoning lightnings from the sky. Moving on to Thanos.. He was there, but he wasn't really. The villain that Infinity War built is not there and even worse, he goes out of character claiming to destroy the Universe and how he will enjoy torturing Earth. Last but not least, the typical feministic cringy bull****.. Captain Marvel has the gauntless and the only ones running to protect her are the female Avengers? All my **** lolz at that scene.This movie took a huge **** on what Infinity War had built and scrapped everything that made it great. Sadly, we live in an age where people have low standards and get manipulated by heavy marketing so I expect this movie to be considered a ""success"".",-1
"First spoiler alert, Iron man dies, black widow dies and Captain avenger retires, Thor puts on weight. (In the beginning of Movie he kills Thanos the inevitable who has lost all the stones and leaving alone in a planet after the destruction now the movie is all about going back to how it was before Thanos)Movie starts with stony stark being in space, then Captain Marvel comes all the way rescues him.Total movie is based on time travel and setting everything back in place, ant man is the guy who gives the plan of time travel where they go back and collect all the stones and defeat Thanos the inevitable.Movie has lot of curse words and sentences from all the superheros. Humour is always seen with Hulk and Thor, not to miss Iron man and Spider man here.So it is technically all the heros go to the past, get the stones and changes everything in present but while they have gone to past to get stones, Thanos comes in with them from the past to the present. Even though they change everything Thanos is also back from past to present and the end war happens, so at the end Iron Man kills Thor by snapping his finger using 5 stones and he dies.Black widow gives her life for soul stone, Captain America retires and goes back to his past finds his love.Overall I think Captain Marvel is the strongest hotest and sexiest super hero",0
"Firstly the pacing and story of this film are atrocious, time travel is the uncreative writers go-to. All the hype and anticipation you'll have for this movie will evaporate in like 15 mins then it'll take about an hour of flashback **** that feels like watching snippets of the old films. There is like 30 mins in this film that is good. Also they take some of their best loved chars and makes them objects of ridicule.",0
"Firstly, I've liked the score this movie had taken on metacritic. Because, I think it's fair to give it 77 despite of to give 80 or more score. Because; it totally does not deserve the score they gave on this movie at IMDB. Secondly, it is not a bad movie and actually I liked this movie, however it can not be a cult for neither me nor the people who is not the fan of Marvel Cinematic/Comic Universe. Furthermore, I'm speaking with truth that I am a fan of Marvel Cinematic Universe. Even so, it couldn't change my score on this movie.If it is needed to say the reasons that I gave this score.1.From the very beginning of the movie to mid-break, it gives the feelings about how is the life after Infinity War and tells us which character doing what. Of course its telling level of tales is upper than some stage as usual, however it is not the best even if you look at in the whole corpus of Avengers.2.After mid-break things starts to move a li'l bit. And a humor that is above the average will wait you on this part.3.I can't tell what is exactly going on that scene because of the fact that it's a spoiler, but something that told by Bruce Banner in a very complicated manner at a very very li'l amount of time will be contradicts what is happening on the last scene of the movie. And again it is something about 'time' to give a clue for the folks who already watched the movie.4. The very best scene is I think the fight scene. And it is not a spoiler that there is a fight on this movie. Almost everything gets concluded on this part even I'm almost satisfied with this part.5.However, I want to ask to the producers, scenarists and directors of the whole hacking Hollywood that 'Why the hack that you intrude feminism on all movies. Yeah we understood there is also heroines, amazons and lots of armpit hair. So, you don't need to forcibly attached feminism and anti-racism on every single movie. We all know that women are worthy creatures just like men and we also can say it for the black and white and even for yellow what's more green people.'So if those 3rd and 5th reasons wouldn't be here I could give 80 point to this very high potentialed movie, however I'm telling it in mouth of gloom that I gave 70/100 on it.",0
Five words: Marvel at this cinematic universe.Avengers: Endgame is not a 3-hour movie. It’s a 10-year affair. And your decade-long investment will come superbly rewarded.Holding-back-tears count: 5x,1
"For 10 years , it has been leading to this ... and I'm not disappointed , but a little sad to say goodbye - we can't spit on it but they've become icons of our generations For a guy like , it was very emmotional , even if it's not the best superhero film of all time , you can't deny , it ends perfectly the saga ; Thanks to the whole cast (thanks RDJ) , you made grow up - and that's the most important",1
For a movie full of plotholes and inconsistencies I feel like it has been doing well in reviews and box office. A movie with great and epic superhero moments but at the end it's just that: another superhero movie.,-1
"For people who arent big fans of the mcu, the movie is not that interesting. However it does a good job in finishing the 3rd phase of the franchise",0
"Found myself having a big stupid grin on my face for a majority of this movie. No, it's not perfect, but it's good and at a time where many movies can't keep a plot coherent through two or three movies, they pulled off a decade long series tying 21 other movies together into one satisfying climax. I'd see all 3 hours of it again today.",1
"Full of plotholes, weird/illogical character decisions, weird/illogical world building, numerous writing decisions and moments that are clearly put there with an agenda, etc. For what it promised, rather disappointing.",-1
"Fun action movie with some feels, but only a few laughs. Giving a crap about the central characters add points to this experience for sure. A fitting end for most of the characters. It was a darn shame how they handled Black Widow and Thor. Well this is the personal endgame for my interest entire Marvel franchise. It can only all go down hill from this point so I am out.",1
Fun and action packed. Respects what has come before and does fan service very well. Really good capstone of all the MCU movies that have come before.,1
Fun film but massively overrated. The final battle was a tedious cycle of cliches with nothing but good cgi to back it up and there was no shortage of plot holes and conveniences.,-1
"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.",1
"going back in time is overpowered, thanos won in the last movie, now always when heroes lose something just go back in time and win again? oops the villain got what he wanted, let's go back in time and win, in my opinion the movie is overrated, the infinity war was a thousand times better.",-1
"Good conclusion to an awesome sega, story was good. Action was great. At the same time the pacing was terrible. But still very good.",1
"Good guy wants to save people. Bad guy wants to kill people. Woah look at that superpower. Woah look those two super heroes I like are teaming up. Look at these expensive action shots you absolute dullard and shut up. I will say I was entertained for the first half, but not being a fanboy it mostly felt like a trip to the DMV. Theres nothing convoluted or unique really in the themes or ideas it tries to explore. I took nothing away from it and it felt way too long. It seems like consumerism and American culture in its purest form. Nothing substantial just shiny stuff, marketing, and people being cool based off the powers they have, rather then their character.",-1
"Good in all types,Has a good acting,good history,and in my opinion taked the essence from other avengers movie and make it even better",1
"Good movie, a thrilling 3 hours. Very emotional and had a good plot and very likable characters.",1
Good movie. It deserved all the hype that it got. Would definitely recommend it to friends.,1
Good special effects. Pretty much everything else sucked almost beyond imagination.,-1
"Good, a solid movie that reconnet and offer closure to some aspects of the franchise...after about 10 years of Marvel cinematic universe it wasn't an easy task to accomplish. Kudos to that.  But It's a little inferior to Infinity war or Avengers 1:Some parts are well made but other not so much...like the majority of the humorous parts (too many and too silly). Thor and Hulk are really bad represented here.Other than that it's a must watch..the day after the movie premiere I spotted people (and tv news) in my country talking about superheroes and not about the last soccer match...for and old nerd like me It's a little revolution...and in a good way.",1
"Great ending but I still can't get over the fact that the writers had to kill my all-time favorite Avenger, Iron Man. Still, it was a sacrifice that must be taken for the greater good. I love the movie!",1
"Great movie, but one thing i dont like, the feminism at the end, its so cringey so thats why im taking -5 from 10",-1
"Great movie, sadly some of the plot holes and overly funny scenes make this movie not perfection. But in summary, this is still a worthwhile movie for MCU's 11-year journey",1
"Great performance by Robert Downey Jr., drama, surprisingly great fanservice, breathtaking final battle but a lot of plot holes and stuff that didn't make much sense",0
Greatest Marvel Movie ever. Infinity war was amazing but Endgame tops it no doubt.,1
"Had so many emotions while watching this. Great ending for a generation of movies. Still, so many charaters had to stay in the background because 3-hour movie is not enough.",1
"Had to check my watch during the first 2 hours, not because of a lack of action, heck, most of my favorite movies have zero or near zero action in them, but because it was just a yawn inducing cringing fest. And the last hour was just as cringy.I'm done with the Marvel/Superheros ""grandiose"" movies I guess. Only Marvel movies I'll watch going forward will probably be the Doctor Strange ones.",-1
Hands down best movie of the year for me it was sad happy action packed and a great way to finish Tony’s story “I love you 3000”,1
"Hands down to Stanley, the Russo Brothers, the cast and all the people behind this movie. The culmination of several movies eventually leading to this one great of a story, in the end, satisfied the forever kid in me.",1
"Here are the pros and consPros:OG AvengersThanosGood payoffBrie Larson had minimal screen timeEnding creditsCons:Very slow first actPlot holesWahmen/Wamin cringe scene (Dammit. Would rate this movie really higher without the SJW Feminism injected through this scene)This really is the end of the MCU. Everything else down the road will be forced diversity and toxic feminism.Thank you, Stan Lee.",-1
"Here's the skinny. You'll watch this 3 hour borefest for only one good reason; the 20 minutes of worth-while content that happens in the form of a battle. Before that, and after that-not worth watching. The Battle still isn't as good as the Airport battle in Civil War. It's a disappointing movie.",-1
"History repeats itselfJennifer Aniston and Martin Scorsese should have thought twice before commenting on Marvel movies just after Stan Lee's death. Why not do it while he was still alive? Stan Lee had invested all his energy and love to defend the characters he created, hoping that one day, they could be presented on the big screen. He had spent most of his life trying to achieve this. If he were still alive, Stan Lee would have immediately reacted and shamed those two people. I am not talking about those two marvelous creators but of the individuals they are. One must always distinguish the creations of an artist from the person the creator actually is. One may like Woody Allen movies without having to like the person. In literature, I love Journey to the End of the Night but dislike and resent the pro-fascist, antisemitic author, Louis-Ferdinand Céline.For those not aware of Martin Scorsese and Jennifer Aniston’s comments:Martin Scorsese said: “Marvel movies are not Cinema. Honestly, the closest I can think of them (the MCU films), as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.”Jennifer Aniston thinks Marvel is ‘ruining cinema.’In the mid-50s and especially in the early 1960s, rock has burst onto the music scene with singers such as Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, and bands such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Doors, which were soon followed by Santana, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, to name a few. Classical music lovers treated this new musical trend with disdain and contempt and considered it by no means to be music. Shortly after, this so-called ""noise"" pushed aside classical music and invaded the media.Today, again, history is repeating itself.Thanks to special effects, a new genre of films has taken cinemas by storm. In terms of audience and revenue, the MCU surpasses anything that has been done before. If these films are what the public wants to see, is that not all that matters?Martin Scorsese has written, directed, and produced masterpieces - The Departed, Gangs of New York, Casino, GoodFellas, The Aviator, Shutter Island... Jennifer Aniston was a wonderful woman in Marley and Me, Derailed, The Good Girl, and, for 10 years, the lovely Rachel Green, in Friends. In their own particular fashion, both were game-changers.How can a genius such as Martin Scorsese not understand that something new and unexpected like the MCU can be a game-changer? The MCU will keep on attracting viewers until either another technological revolution brings us completely different films, impossible to imagine today, or the MCU will run out of ideas, or viewers will get tired of this kind of movies just as viewers got tired of other genres which have completely disappeared, such as the Western whose audience appears to be drying up... The MCU won’t be on the forefront forever.",-1
"Honestly, it felt like it was too much of a set-up for me. Having Antman isolated in the Quantum realm was just too convenient and it felt like Marvel was just looking for a foundation for the script they had for this movie that wasn't even as good as the previous ones.",0
"horrible film, plot bordering on total and absolute crap... with a single exciting scene, I think the grade I gave would still be too good for what it was",-1
"Hulk's arc = completed off camera. Thor's ark = we undo the work of the last 3 Thor movies and infinity war. Iron Man's arc = emotional but predictable. Captain America's arc = completely out-of-character and selfish. Black Widow's arc = emotional and powerful, but it was a poor sendoff for a great character. Hawkeye's arc = his Ronan plot was underdeveloped and seemed a bit pointless, but overall his was the most consistent arc of the movie aside from Black Widow's. Overall, this movie was a huge fail, and makes me not want to watch the old films since their plots mean nothing after Endgame destroys them.",-1
"I absolutely hated this movie, i thought it was boring, poorly written and inconsistent...-Time travel and the way it is used in this movie absolutely sucks, it's so convenient and almost without negative repercussions to the main time line..-Thor and Hulk are a joke in this movie.(Thor is too weak even with two hammers and the Odinforce and is fat, drinks alcohol and plays Fortnite and Hulk is basically Ruffalo with CGI and doesn't participate in any action scenes)-Captain Marvel and the way she is portrayed in this film is horrible, she just comes and one shots Thanos's entire army while Thor with 2 hammers and the Odinforce can't do anything.-in a movie with time travel elements in which they just resurrected the entire marvel universe how can Tony Stark die?can't they just go back in time and get him? (we have Gamora from the PAST living in the PRESENT now!!!)i get it that the actor's contract is ending but still..-Thor abandons his people and leaves with the Guardians???wow that was laughable, they are probably planning for a New Asgard series so probably because Hemsworth can't participate they just had to put him out of the picture like this?-Falcon is the new Captain America?why???isn't he just a regular guy..why not Bucky for example?-all female superhero moment...the amount of cringe!!!-the tone of the movie is like this...pointless drama with bad jokes-the last battle is pretty impressive but doesn't last for long and captain marvel totally ruins it...-they should have used the marvel cosmic beings and give this battle much bigger scale, after all thanos affected the entire universe not only earth.-Nebula kills her past self while being in the present and SURVIVES??!?!?!?-Pepper Pots is able to pilot the iron man armor like a pro, better than War Machine.-Dr. Strange does absolutely nothing in this movie, he just collect all the heroes off screen and opens some portals in the end, oh and he uses an aoe spell for half a second. These are only some of the flaws with this movie..Of course it will make a lot of money but it's mostly due to the hype and Disney's promotion which is essentially the best in the market...",-1
"I am a bit amazed, that this movie has so high score from fans. I am huge fan of MCU and even movies which by some reason a lot of people thinks that are weak I have still liked. I like superheroes, I like idea behind them. There are movies with stronger stories, there are movies with stronger visual effects, but in general all of them are good..... up until Avengers Endgame. Can I say that I regret that I watched it? No... after all I wanted to see what they think about this, how Marvel see ending of Infinity Saga. Everything in this shared universe was build somehow with the idea of this movie and in the end we receive some strange comedy. The best thing in the movie was constant flow of stupid jokes from every character. It wasn't about superheroes anymore. Half of the characters received some strange ""development"" which totally change who they are and turn them either in whiny baby or in stupid nerd. Marvel constantly breaks the rule of time travelling which they put in the movie. They just try to explain something and in a few scenes after that they do something totally different it seems to be alright. But even this is not the problem.... the problem is time travel itself. This was more like they wanted to play some nostalgia on the viewers, than to build some story. Yea, its nice to remember all this good movies, but I WANTED to see some original story. I understand that it is hard always to create something original and totally different... but come on, that was final of 21 movies and 10 years of development and you was lazy to think for something different than Time Travel? We just go back in time and fix it. Human imagination is endless and you came wit this. Especially in comic books where multiverse is integral part of the universe, we just time travel and fix the wrong. I expected to see that 50% of all living forms remained in one universe while other 50% have be send in other multiverse or something like that. More complicated scenario, where of course we will save everyone, but it will have some interesting and logical explanation why. That plot was slap in the face for me. The weakest plot in all MCU in a movie which actually needed to show the best of it. And even not like the movie was that bad... it was watchable. There was good moments, good visual effects.  If it was for example some generic movie as Deadpool or Shazam or Ant-man... I would say ok, not the best plot, but nice movie, but not for Avengers, not after all this year. It just needed to be much much more, they could do it, we deserved it. The way they retire old avengers was ridiculous. As Marvel itself said, everything should come to an end, but their end should be Infinity wars, not this... they really make one step after the end and break everything beautiful in it. So I would personally put even lower score, because they have failed to make a good ending, but after all if we forget about the story (which actually for me was the biggest part of the score) it was good movie as quality. A lot of pew pew, boom boom in it, good for watching and for eye.",-1
I am a follower of superhero movies but to be frank this was pathetic.... Unlike the first three avengers i had to forward this one just to end it.... I am wondering about all these people adding positive reviews on here... Have they even watch this movie?... Anyway that is my opinion,-1
"I am going to keep this brief as I don't want to give as much away as I normally feel inclined to do. If the MCU is a TV series, then Endgame is the series/season finale. It's big, it's grand, it's emotional, and best of all... it's PERFECT. Now I don't mean it's the perfect movie, 'cause it's not. It has its fair share of problems, but they are TINY... NITPICKS, actually. But that's not important, what is important is does Endgame stick the landing? Yes, it does. It's the perfect send off to 10/11 years of movies, fans, characters, stories, and to the people we watched grow in front of our eyes. It's a strange feeling that  I have not had since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. There will not be another movie like this ever, or rather not for a VERY long time. In terms of rank, as I'm sure you all do wonder, it's their best. They pull no stops and they are unforgiving at times, but that's a good thing. I'm glad I watched this movie, I'm glad I'll get to watch it, then watch it again. But best of all, I'm happy to enjoy the moments I've had with this franchise and the characters I've grown attached to. Even though the sun has set on the MCU, that doesn't necessarily mean that the sun shall remain set... because when the sun sets, we can always remember that it will always rise again the following morning. And boy oh boy, I can't wait for both.",1
"I am so happy Brie Larson had such a tiny role in this, made it so much more enjoyable. Other than that, it was your run-of-the-mill sequel to Infinity War that was supposed to tie together a bunch of films. It was great, but not groundbreaking.",1
"I believe that this is Marvel's best film by far. It was everything I had hoped for and then some. It wraps up some storylines, renews some others, and sets up the next phase of the MCU very well. Also, this is one of the few three hour films I've ever watched that maintained my interest the entire runtime.",1
"I cannot genuinely give Endgame anything less than a 7/10 rating. The film was good, but it most certainly wasn't better than Infinity War. It's pretty much the Return of the Jedi of the saga. The final battle was entertaining, seeing all the characters brought back was the best, and watching Thanos turn to dust was cool. However, a lot of people are disappointed with what they did to Thor's character; they mindlessly nerfed him. Overweight Thor in the beginning was ok. He wanted to live a normal life, and he felt guilty for failing to defeat Thanos.However, they kept him that way all throughout the entire movie. It was disgraceful. His character digressed with very little payoffs, if any. It wouldn't take long for the God of Thunder to get in shape. He's not an average joe. It's like they purposely kept him that way because they wanted to show the full power and capabilities of Captain America. Thor wanting his revenge on Thanos after failing in Infinity War would have worked, too.As for Captain Marvel, she was barely even in the movie, which is a good thing because fans despise the actress, and yet, she made one of the greatest undeserved impacts on helping to defeat Thanos, while destroying the ship all by herself. Not to mention, the Hulk didn't fight Thanos at all in this film. There are some choices made by the writers that some people don't agree with. If not Thor snapping Thanos away, he should have worked together with Marvel and the Hulk to hold him off, so Tony could later do it.Needless to say, time travel can be so convoluted because no rules are established here.﻿ Wouldn't Nebula killing her other self alter the future? Like what was stated by War Machine, they easily could have gone further back in time to kill Thanos as a baby. However, we wouldn't have had a great film had they chose to do that. There were so many different timelines explored in this movie. If you sit down and think long and hard about it, anyone can pick Act II apart. Furthermore,﻿ they didn't show much of Bucky with Captain America either. The real hero in this film was the mouse for accidentally bringing Ant-Man back. This scene would have been so much more believable had it shown a few homeless people messing around with the equipment. A mouse, really? Iron Man's sacrifice was duly noted along with Black Widow's. The Marvel movies had a fantastic run. For another positive, I liked Iron Man's short interaction with Spiderman. Next, when Capt. America grabbed the mjolnir and fought Thanos. Plus, the writers worked more to give Hawkeye a more in-depth character by showing his family. These were great, memorable scenes. All in all, it's still worth buying on BluRay.",0
"I cannot say this movie was a solid 7/10. Many parts of it were 10/10, especially the parts surrounding the core Avengers, but the blatant fanfiction-tier politically motivated inserts brought the movie down in many ways. EDIT: Metacritic, WTF are you doing to my new lines?--Minor Spoilers follow--First, the good: This movie brings a solid and satisfying conclusion to the stories of some of the main avengers, and felt like a proper send-off to some of the best characters. The acting was A+, the effects were par for a Marvel movie, and the overall plot felt like a good continuation of Infinity War. --The Mixed-- This was kind of expected, but the way to figure out how to beat the most powerful being in the universe who has control of all of space and time felt like a giant deus ex machina. SPOILER: it's time travel. The Bad: Apparently, the original plan was to not feature Captain Marvel, and it shows. Her inclusions in the movie come out of left field and ultimately don't add much to the story. There were also a few scenes that broke continuity who's only purpose seemed to be to feature a bunch of female characters kicking butt. It felt as if they were just tacking things on to check off some boxes so the media hounds don't give them negative reviews. These things can be done well, as we saw with movies like Rogue One, but it was not done well here. Finally, there's never a rebuttal to Thanos's theory that the universe needs to be culled in order to survive. This theory was presented so strongly in Infinity War that I had a few friends thinking ""yeah, you know? Thanos was right. Thanos is the true hero!"". This movie does nothing to change our minds about that. To follow up on my Captain Marvel review, I called it (...mostly): Captain marvel is so powerful she singlehandedly wins the final battle for the Avengers, but she doesn't defeat Thanos. Frankly, it was pretty satisfying to see Thanos punch her smug face and send her flying, especially considering that was the first blow she receives on-screen after unlocking her full power in the Captain Marvel movie.",0
"I can't give more than 6 to this film that is nothing compared to Infinity War. 3 hours are too many and the beginning of this film is so slow,here is the reason of the 3 hours. I didn't like Thor at all because for me that's not the real Thor.About Professor Hulk I can say that I wanted more insights of the character which is not well studied.The only part of this film that I liked was the end, the final battle, ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!""",-1
"I did like the movie, but... I really did not like the time-travel aspect. I think it works in some movies but I couldn't get into the whole time-travel thing in this one. I did love the last half of the movie and characters like Iron Man and Hawkeye. Tom Holland as Spider-Man is still one of my favorite characters in the franchise. I just feel like it could have been better.",-1
"I don't get the hype behind the movie. All that happened was that they went back in time and stolen the infinity stones before Thanos got them. Then thanos gets wind of it and travels to their time. Then a big fight happens where there's tons of booms and such. Everyone was playing 'keep away' with the stones. Some people were put on a mantle *coughmostlythefemalescough* while a few people died on screen. Then one hero uses the stones to 'snap' away all of thanos's troops, this guy dies and everyone gets sad over it. There's some narration by the dead dude and all other heroes continue on their day to day activities. That was the whole movie sum'ed up and honestly? This whole movie just felt really cliche'd and average at best. I wasn't that invested in anything and I actually grown bored with all the drama and sob stories that was constantly occurring. The action scenes were too flashy and just all over the place and while there was some unexplained plotholes in the film and even a large amount of dangling threads, I honestly think they're just planning on explaining those things in a future film or something. Regardless, not worth seeing unless you are heavily invested in the Marvel franchise you might like the movie but as for me, a person not invested heavily in the Marvel Franchise?  I thought it was just and average cliched film at best.",-1
"I don't know why they didn't like this movie but I absolutely loved it, the only downside is that the 3 hour movie is too long.",1
"I don't like these disney-marvel movies, I prefer batman of burton and nolan , and spiderman of raimi.",-1
I expected people to die but I wanted more people to die. And why can’t Gwyneth Paltrow die?,0
I feel like my biggest problem with this movie is simply the fact the first half is way longer then it needs to be. I feel like it was drawn out simply so they could make a big show about how the movie is three hours long. Besides that though the movies pretty good. Exactly what most people want out of a marvel movie with the same problems and that's perfectly fine. A fitting end to this era of marvel films.,-1
"I finally watched this movie.  And I came away terribly disappointed.  Infinity War barely held its story together and allowed some characters to shine.  This sequel seemed to be written and directed by people with Attention-Deficit Disorder.  It jumped from one set of heroes to another entirely different set not once or twice but several times.  They kept changing the nonsensical time-travel rules to fit whatever the writers wanted to happen next.  There was never any core group of lead characters for the viewer to latch onto and to actually care about.  This unfocused and nonsense ruined any feelings of danger or threat.  So, when the strongest women in the universe saved the day I no longer cared.  Blow the Earth up!  Who cares!  They'll just go back in time again and start over.  Maybe with better writing.",-1
"I found the first 75% of this movie to be some of the best and most poignant writing in the Marvel movies.  While some might have found it slow, I found it emotionally deep.However, it kinda felt like, near the end, that they abandoned the plot and just said ""Let's have a giant, epic battle"".And it really doesn't matter that they define their ""time travel"" as ""not Back to the Future"" because they ultimately disregard their own rules on time travel anyway.No matter how you turn it or look at it, one way or the other, their actions at the end of the movie don't make sense.Either what you do in the past is important, or it's not.  It creates alternate timelines, or it doesn't.  You just can't have it both ways.So while I liked the first 3/4 of the movie, the ending was just the same old Hollywood tripe meant to appeal to certain kinds of people.And I guess, looking at the reviews:  they succeeded there.",-1
"I grew up with the marvel universe and i have to say this is the most perfect send-off for the most perfect series of all time. Everything in the movie works well the scenes gel together nothing is ham-fisted the jokes in the movie just like nearly every other Marvel movie are laugh out loud. It's funnier then alleged comedies. Its like three movies in one but it all works. Its an edge of your seat action movie, A laugh out loud comedy and has depressing scenes that are tear jerking. Altogether is perfect nd amazing fan-service.",1
"I had to multiu-task watching this mish mash hodge podge. I think the task of wrapping up so many movies stood against it, and for those who did not see 80% of the previous movies, this one had to many ""meaningful"" scenes that meant nothing to me. As usual with all these, a major clice-fest, but then what do you expect with a movie aimed at action-movie mentality. Effects are nice, bla bla, but yawn, we know they will be, obvs... a bit more depth maybe, naaah, that's asking too much. 4/10",-1
"I had wowed never again to watch another movie with the hideously lazy Robert Downey Jr in it. I had wowed even more to never again watch another movie containing the even more lazy and awful Chris Pratt. Ditto for the abysmal Chris Evans, whose only job is to be ""handsome"". Ruffalo, Johanson, Hemsworth, Cumberbatch; this movie must contain all the laziest actors in the world. Well, Jeff Goldblum isn't in it, so I guess that's one positive. They even managed to either dig up Robert Redford, or reanimate him with computer graphics, to do yet another non-role, exactly as pointless and lame as his last twenty roles were.But above all I had wowed to not waste any more money on the Marvel garbage that they keep churning out, and which people seem to like for some inexplicable reason. So why did I find myself in the movie theater watching this absurdly dumb and tedious movie? Because I'm a moron. What other explanation can there be?If you can survive the bad actors and their incessant oneliners; of two general types: ""clever"" oneliners and ""funny"" oneliners, all the ""dialog"" this movie contains; the actual movie isn't so much a narrative as it is a collection of gags, drowned in special effects. The characters are nonexistent. There is sexy and ""funny"", big and ""funny"", green and ""funny"", young and ""funny"", and about 30 different variations of have breasts and ""funny"". Those last ones also have to prove that they are braver and better than the ones without breasts, as well as ""funny"". Because the movie wasn't boring enough, so we decided to lecture people about ""feminism"" again too. And these are all the characters the movie contains, and all reciting bad oneliners the entire movie long. I wanted to get up and leave after five minutes, yet did not. Moron, see?Other than that it is identical to the last boring Avengers movie, which I was smart enough to download for free and play in the background while doing something far more interesting with my time. They have simply imported Back to the Future and overlaid it on this movie. Hey, if the peasants will watch anything we vomit out, why not. right? The entire torment of a movie is a self-referential stew of all the reasons I hate Hollywood. And now I also hate Marvel.My favorite scene was easily the ""funeral"" of Tony Stark, the just ""funny"" character, obnoxiously played by Downing. The camera panned slowly through the crowd, and I had absolutely no idea who most of the characters were, but was clearly supposed to. Monica Geller's boyfriend from Friends even made an appearance for some reason, although that was never explained. Perhaps Friends was taking place in the Marvel ""universe"" all along. It was somewhere between pathetic and funny. I couldn't decide.And of course, violins for when we're supposed to feel sad, cellos for when we're supposed to feel even sadder, horns for when we're supposed to get excited, clarinets for when we're supposed to think something was funny and all the other cliches of Hollywood brainwashing they could come up with. So it's not just bad; it aggressively insults you. I am starting to think that they really do have some machine somewhere making these movies. I can't think of any other explanation. Humans could not make something this utterly soulless, could they? This movie is so insultingly bad on every single level that I cannot believe people actually like it. Are they putting stuff in the drinking water again? I have to ask...",-1
I have no words for this movie just speechlessthis movie has everything that a fan wants to see its just fantastic masterpiece it is a once in a lifetime generation event,1
"I have probably rated this higher than I would have out of the weight of the stories that came before it and seeing the culmination of events, it seems like matters really have weight to them despite things being undone. A more serious movie that suits my taste better with a tone and drama to it not present so much before in the likes of Ragnarok and co. I have serious problems with the time travel nonsense of what and who can do what and I was majorly let down by the portrayal of Thor at seemingly the need to have Captain Mundane fill his role at the end and the treatment of Black Widow (despite Scarletts great acting I feel her character has been dealt with shabbily)",0
I have seen endgame last night and I was blown away by the stupidity of the plot and dialogues. I am not a die hard fan of the franchise but 2:30h of sentimental whining and grieving + 30 minutes of proper action just doesn't work for me.,-1
"I have to admit, I got so emotional all throughout the movie and some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.",1
"I have watched all of the MCU and watch videos about the comics. I loved infinity war and this movie is definitely inferior to it. End Game had so much more to cover and conclude and falls short for it. The pacing suffers, going way to fast at the beginning yet dragging in the middle and then rushing the end. Also many characters are thrown aside, or even destroyed for the sake of convenience and comedy. Thor was probably the worst example. His whole very tragic story of everyone he loves dying and his vengeance fate but in this movie he is a useless, fat loser who even loses the one thing that makes him unique to the other heros, his ability to wield mjolnir, which can now be wielded by captain, which is cool, but in a film that trashes on thor, makes him feel even more pathetic. And I love Thor but even in the cinema I was in, when they are having their serious fight with Thanos, people were laughing at Thor just because he was fat. And Hulk was also severely side lined. After they cut him out of infinity war, fans were expecting to see him return and smash in the final fight, but he doesn't because he is (weirdly smaller) smarter hulk with a broken arm! The other thing that made me roll my entire body in the cinema in cringe was the political elements. There was dead silence every time captain Marvel showed up and no clapping or cheering for the feminist moment in the final fight. The way I see it is nobody wants politics in your movies! They also scared me by making me think captain Marvel was going to save the day but she does get slapped around so it balances out, as all things should be. In summary, infinity war had a better villain, better pacing and more emotional impact but you will enjoy it if you ignore the political jokes (and Brie Larson) and plot holes",-1
"I I am very upset. They killed Our Marvel Heros because they didn't want a happy ending? Seriously? It's a movie, I don't go to the movies to cry I go to leave my reality and enter a dream world were everything is perfect, especially our Marvel characters. They had a da m time stone. Reverse time and bring everyone back alive, end of story!I hate that Captain Marvel didn't save the day like she was supposed too. I hate that they women had a small part in this movie and I'm not a feminist. They made it an Iron Man and Captain America movie. Then nobody could take down Thanos? Come man, you use his weaknesses to take him down.The reason people ran to see this movie because they wanted to see what happens.I'm very disappointed. I felt like this was rushed to make a dime off of hard core fans. I gave it two stars because the war at the end was the best part!The End!",-1
"I know I’m going to P people off, but you could skip 1 hour in and know what happened. It’s inferior to the original because of the ending. Thanos won Endgame and that was surprising because in 99.9 percent of Superhero movies, they always win. This time, they lost. I won’t spoil the ending, but I will say they won. And this is the highest grossing movie?! Come on people.",-1
"I know Ironman is the central character but I thought they could at least give equal amount of show time for other late coming MCU superheros. Particularly, I really don't like how they treated Hulk and Antman. They changed a lot from the comic, and we all know the plot is tailor-made for few stars who will be leaving the MCU after the movie. After all, the movie is just a tremendous fan services and astronomical amount of paycheck for Disney executives and movie stars.",-1
I laughed I cried and was happy this is one of the best films I have ever seen from the mcu thank you marvel spoiler at the bottomI am Iron Man may he rest in piece thank you for making this legacy TonyNatasha and Cap will rest to,1
"I left the theatre with mixed emotions.  After 10+ years invested in the MCU and Infinity War (the best of all the Marvel movies!), my expectations were probably unrealistically high.  The movie brought a lot of closure to the MCU.  But the failed to deliver anything close to Infinity War.   It’s a must watch for any fan of the MCU.",-1
I Love Avengers Endgame it concretes on the right where Infinity War left off. this is one of my favorite movies in mcu,1
"I love marvel cinema universe, I watched all the films. I can say that 3 hours is enough for the film to contain both the epic, and the plot, and everything possible. The film is very boring at the beginning, I understand that it must be sad at the beginning, but not as tedious. The middle is even less intrinsic, but still far from the most interesting. I would give the film 6 points, but the final battle is fantastic. I have not seen such a battle in more than one film. It was probably the most epic that I saw. Therefore, since I love marvel, and for the epic battle at the end, I put 8 points. 10 points film does not deserve.",1
"I loved infinity wars, and seen/liked nearly all of the other movies in the series. Unfortunately Endgame falls short in quite a few areas. I certainly don't mind a long movie, but that comes with the assumption that something is happening in that time. There was some good, but mostly a lot wrong with the movie which I'll break down.Pro:-For the most part the final fight scene is well done and visually exciting.-Tony Stark scene is sad, but ultimately a fitting end to his character arc.-Quite a few jokes, though perhaps this is unfitting for what is supposed to be an action film.Cons:- Captain Marvel completely ruins the pace and tone of the movie. Every scene she is in leaves you rolling your eyes. This Mary Sue character is so much stronger than every other character and avenger that while their entire team is trying to save one planet, she is off  saving ""thousands"" (in her words). Her story, and character is unconvincing, and she is so incredibly powerful that she upstages every other person in the movie. She destroys Thanos's battlecruiser (A ship the size of a small city) by literally flying through it with her fist. But not before being blasted by its cannons (And shrugging it off totally unaffected). The same cannons that had just annihilated the entire avengers compound into literal rubble. She then proceeds to eliminate half an army before fighting Thanos who has all infinity stones. Earlier Thor, Captain America, and Iron man all fight Thanos without the stones, and are beaten. Yet Thanos with the gauntlet is no match for her as she shrugs off a blow from him and laughs about it. I was worried by every scene with her leading up to this point that she was going to swoop down and single handedly save the day, which would completely invalidate the ""teamwork"" tone of the rest of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally written that way but changed last minute.- Iron man and Nebula are floating out in space, and who comes in to save the day? Yes you guessed it. The incredible Captain Marvel. Super being who is able to fly through space unprotected (No need for oxygen) at apparently faster than light speeds, and has the omnipotent knowledge of exactly where these two were floating at somewhere in space. Tony Stark is supposed to be a super genius, and he has the help of an android. Yet they couldn't work together to create some solution to save themselves? No. Instead super being swoops in on a literal golden beam of light to save the day. Disappointing, emasculating and anti-climactic.- The time travel plot was pretty disappointing, and left a lot of loopholes. Such as thors hammer not being returned, and how changes in the past wouldn't affect the present. How they would be sent to an alternate universe. Well then I must point out that the original universe that thanos half destroyed would still persist, and upon returning the heroes would be sent to another universe which they would then change. It opens up so many holes in the story I don't have enough room to go on. Why time travel? 10 years of writing, millions of dollars, and they resort to that cliche? Very disappointing.- Thanos is ambushed and killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Really? Everyone going into the movie is expecting a secondary power to counter his, or a long build up and occasional conflicts with thanos or something of the sort. Instead he dies without a fight, the movie has no villain, and instead they spend 2 hours making jokes and playing up overly dramatic scenes.- Thanos himself was ruined as a character. He was the ultimate villain in the previous movie, but in this one he barely seen any screen time. He had no character development, and ultimately after a trivial struggle with every other avenger, he was brought down by Captain Super Being and her sidekick Scarlet Jedi.  Leaving him distracted just enough to let Tony Stark snatch the stones away under his nose.- Thor was ruined. Really sad what they did to him. He had so much passion and such a great story arc in and leading up to Infinity War. Then they turned him into a fat drunken clown. Literally making booze jokes through nearly every scene, being called fat jokes, and generally being worthless and unheroic. - Dr.Strange, perhaps one of my favorite avengers did nothing the whole movie but hold back a wave of water for a few minutes. - No post credits scene. Every single other movie had a final scene at the end of the credits, but not the final movie? Not even a joke reference? A dozen people stayed in the theatre I was in and were all audibly disappointed.Overall the movie was enjoyable through parts. But I feel like Disney is going to ruin the future marvel movies. I think Captain Marvel is a good indicator of what is coming ahead. Unrelatable super heroes with unbelievable powers flying through space and saving thousands of planets at a time. Honestly...What villain can even compete?",-1
I loved it I saw it in cinemas 4 times I would have seen it a 5th time but I ran out of money 10 years of build up was fully worth it,1
"I loved this movie, it was a great finish to 10 years of generally good movies (with the one exception). There were moments I jumped out of my seat I was enjoying it so much. Obviously there were a few bits I disliked. As a tubby bloke I didn’t appreciate the fat jokes. The ending was definitely bittersweet. Worth multiple watches for sure.",1
"I promised never to go on Marvel movies after awful Age of Ultron, and other movies were pretty average to say at least. But sometimes, like in case of Civil War and Infinity War they were pretty good. So I expected from Endgame the same - that it will be a ""good"" Marvel movie. But oh my god... It was just horrible. I will not include spoilers here, but I will say one thing - writers should abandon idea to include time travels in the movies. It doesn't solve anything, but creates just enormous plot holes. Nuff said. 3/10, just for visual.",-1
"I rate it a 7 but it is an absolute must see. Endgame has almost impossibly high expectations following Infinity War which I consider a 10. Endgame is more of an homage to the MCU with one of arguably the best battle scenes in movie history. My only complaints are Hulk has become more of a joke than one of the most powerful characters and Captain Marvel, after not even being on Marvels fans radars a year ago, easily overpowers everyone else. The will have to come up with a new level of villain to even challenge her. But the film is more dedicated to the original Avengers and gives them the honor they deserve. Great movie!",0
I re watch this movie twice and i still done like it . Everything about this was boring . There a few time i try to force at the movie one at the AMC and one at home . It feels like there are some much filter in this film . Its sad how Infinity War a 2hr 30 min movie was enjoyable and it had a good pace . I dont really care for what new MCU is coming out (Beside James Gunn). There few parts of the movie i did like out i no reason to re watch this movie or care,-1
"I really don't like this movie. The plot is ""meh"" and it has a lot of unfunny humor. The visuals are great tho.",-1
"I really don't understand how so many people could enjoy this hot mess? The Russos need to issue a written apology to Taika Watiti for completely undoing everything he worked on, and that's just the START of the things wrong with this movie. Infinity war was awful, but this was a new low.",-1
"I really hate movies that establish clear rules for what is possible, then just ignore them. It's also pretty clear that the ending had to be heavily edited to cut the runtime down to 3 hours.",-1
"I really want to like this movie. But sadly I don't. And even sadder...probably many feel the same. Talk about a collective cacophony of underdeveloped, rushed and even forced plots. I usually judge a film on how much I would want to see it again. On a scale of 1-10 for second viewing, I'd rate this a 2. It just wasn't that enjoyable or interesting. The end result was very predictable and took very few chances-if any, unlike the last film. To have Caps die as an old coward (choosing his gf over the lives he could've saved/impacted) and Iron Man dying a hero made me really conflicted. This film just really feels patronizing and insulting in a 3rd Matrix, Lost Finale/Seinfeld Finale kind of way. And it makes me VERY concerned for Star Wars Ep.9. The 3 hour length isn't what sours the experience. It's how much frivolity and sloppiness that plagues those 3 hours. Its ultimately very forgettable. Even the choppy slapped together editing seems to have lost interest half way through. Its a shame as I feel this was a dead end that Infinity Gauntlet created. There was no successful way out of that rabbits hole...And while Captain Marvel wasn't as integral as many fans feared, she still felt forced into the plot/film and actually served as a major disruption to the flow more than anything. I walked away from this film felling very ""meh"".",-1
"I saw the movie yesterday. I'm not a Marvel fan but I saw the Avengers saga and the last movie was good.- Captain Marvel appears at the beginning of the film with some effects taken from a class B movie following a scene with an extremely arrogant dialogue on his part front of the other Avengers. (Come on! you did not appear in the other movies!). Then she disappears during the next 2 hours of film (I guess she went to take a haircut in that time) and she returns to destroy Thanos' ship in a ridiculous way. No one on earth is capable of destroying it? Or do something? Come on!.- The Incredible Hulk takes two whole movies without even giving a slap. It is one of the most important characters in Marvel comics and his scenes seem that they were of a film of Shrek (With a little more of intellect).- Thor... I have no words to describe how they humiliated one of the strongest Avengers. Marvel should never again print a Thor comic after this. I hope to make a team with him in a videogame or see him in a pub sometime. (Or maybe one day I find him playing bowling with Walter).- I did not finish to understand the trips in the time. More precisely in the scene that Antman returns to the present. I do not remember if it was in a previous movie or when he set up that machine. A friend told me what happened in one of the 23 MCU movies. But if to understand 1 movie I must see 23 movies something is wrong. - Excessive humor in the whole movie. It also happened in all the saga. There are moments of tension that need some seriousness in the movies but are ruined by some silly joke.- Unnecessary feminist fight- I did not like the dialogue of the final scene with Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" and Ironman answering ""I am Iron Man"". I think it would have been better if he said ""We are The Avengers"".Throughout the saga there were moments that seemed to be watching Iron Man movies with sporadic participation of some characters.That final dialogue finished confirming that the saga should be titled as ""Iron Man and The Advengers""- I think the duration was long, maybe 2 and a half hours (or a little less) would have been enough.They missed the opportunity to give a great closing to a saga that began from minor to major.I want to congratulate the sound director and his team. The rest take a break and rethink if you want to continue doing bad movies.",-1
"I see the trolls are already coming out for this film as well, its a damn shame. The film is fantastic, an unparalleled feat of blockbuster filmmaking. The breathtaking action and scale of the last act is amazing to be sure, but it's the first two acts, where delicate character moments, an irreplicable balance of ingenuity and wit, and emotion extracted without veering to the melodramatic (a fine line that only a script and direction as superb as this can walk without teetering) where the film really stands apart. For those who have followed the franchise from the beginning, this is the finale we deserved and then some. Bravo, bravo",1
"I think that people who rate this movie negatively fail to understand the motives and the arc that each character went through during the 22 movies. If your main complain is that Thor got depressed, I suggest you to look up on youtube videos that do some analysis, maybe you can learn how to do them on your own. Some people don't even understand a concept that they explained VERY CLEARLY in the movie. I guess 10 years old do not have the ability to focus for 3 hours on a movie.It's not a perfect movie, but it's the best finale to a movie saga I have ever saw. Just to make a comparison, Harry Potter, which was only 8 movies long and based on a book, came out worst than this one, which was the end of a saga written and directed by many different people.",1
"I thought ‘Avengers: Endgame’ was a great movie, but not without its flaws. It’s deeply satisfying and very entertaining in a lot of ways. The themes of depression and loss are handled very well, and they allow the heroes to feel the most human they’ve felt in a long time.As the conclusion to the twenty two movie and eleven year long ‘Infinity Saga’, it’s pretty much perfect. As a stand alone movie (connection to other Marvel movies aside), it’s good, not great. While there are some glaring plot holes that do ruin a few aspects of the movie, I can forgive most of them. The pros out way the cons here, but the cons are definitely there. I had such a good time watching the movie that I didn’t even notice most of the plot holes (not to say there are a lot) on my first or second viewing, they were pointed out to me in other reviews. Here’s the bottom line, it’s very enjoyable to watch, but the second you apply any kind of logic (including rules they established in this movie) to a lot of the plot points, it begins to crumble, but, it gives some characters satisfying endings and others a bright future.I once said that after ‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’, I would stop watching most Marvel movies, but after this, I think I’ll stick around for a little while.Also, f*ck Captain Marvel, she ruined moments that otherwise would’ve been amazing.",1
I thought I would be able to enjoy it upon hearing that it was gonna be 3 hours long but it turned out to be too much. Watching it felt like a drag and was too melo-dramatic for a superhero film.,-1
I thought that this film does not deserve half the praise it is getting. There are so many better films that don't have such a large budget like marvel and are given half the credit for a film that is so much better. In addition to this the film is massivly flawed and should have left the concept of time travel alone as it only reaches paradox.,-1
"I thought the movie was ok but not great. The writers obviously have no idea about time travel and since that underpinned the whole premise, the entire movie was one big plot hole.  Hulk was a ridiculously unlikable character and the loss of Black Widow was unforgivable.  The SJW agenda found its way into the movie which again was a big disappointment.",-1
I thought this was a really good and emotional film. Easily the best marvel film.,1
I want to commend Hawkeye and Black Widow's friendship. It's not a battle for who will live but a battle for who will die.,1
"I wanted to like this movie. I truly did. I was disappointed with some poor writing in Infinity War and hoped this would repair some of that. It degraded to much worse.I cannot believe people in general are not disappointed with the depth of the story of these past 2 movies.Cons----The time travel is horribly inconsistent and all over the place. The only rules it follows are there are no rules but what we need for the very weak plot.-Characters are purposely watered down to advance the plot. Thor is the latest victim. Hulk was IW.-Scale. Somewhere,the Russos forgot or just genuinely do not care that all the heroes are not the same and have differing abilities.Some of them are regular humans and cannot take a punch from a super powered being or a rocket to the face.  Thanos with or without Gauntlet is inconsistently powered. Cannot stand against Scarlet Witch yet can against Thor powered Captain America and Thor with stormbreaker. I was glad to see Scarlet Witch utilized better, dont get me wrong, but please stick to some sort of power scale here.-Unnecessary Bad Humor. It would have been a better movie with a more flushed out battle giving each character their unique moment than making Fortnite and dapping jokes.-Terrible representation of characters. I was excited about Professor Hulk (from Toys and general promotion it was obvious) only to find no explanation for it and it was just a plot device to keep him out of the fight again.Thor was just a disgrace of a representation. I truly have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Making fun of depression and alcoholism and degrading Thor to this was just dumb. Everyone from Wakanda were just shoehorned into the movie. They had no special moments and were generally just pushed around. Emerging from the portal was their strongest moment.The only fight scene Black Widow had was against Clint. She had minimal role in the rest of the movie. Never truly did anything but die. Had no funeral whatsoever at the end like Tony and was forgotten.Spider-Man was nothing short of useless in this movie. Same can be said of Wasp, Groot, Drax and Star-Lord.Doctor Strange was kept busy with a flood as a plot device.-Clear agenda (that didnt work in the comics either)The ""girl power"" moment was unnecessary and cringe worthy. Forced moments like this are dis-genuine and transparent. Captain Marvel is just setup as a Mary Sue. Saves Iron Man/Nebula with no real story. Clearly overpowered in final battle. If this is the future of Marvel, it seems it is headed for some truly poor writing. A character who is basically the annoying kid you used to play Super Heroes with who made up powers as they went along so you could never win.She has no weaknesses and is basically more powerful than anyone because they decided she is. Nevermind, Shuri who was established as the smartest human in the MCU and her possibly emerging as IronHeart(also a genuinely more like-able actor)..Nope...we are going to go the 9 year old kid version of this. Oh...and of the people we have killed off in these movies, 2 of them are strong females who established themselves as likable heroes with distinct abilities and personalities.I have zero issue with female representation (would rather see She-Hulk introduced myself but that is personal), I do have an issue with poor writing and plot armor. Pros---Callbacks to the timeline.I enjoyed almost every scene with the throwback to the original Avengers movie. Thor visiting his mother was a good moment.Tony and his Dad were well done.-Rocket. Continues to be one of the best Marvel characters whose humor works.Overall, just an extreme disappointment. I thought the original Avengers and Ultron were very well written movies that setup the franchise. I do not feel much different that what happened with the transition from JJ Abrams to Rian Johnson than I do with the transition of Whedon to the Russos. Very poorly handled.I realize that these are Directors not writers, but the Directors decide what storylines get into the movie and which ones do not. Saves Tony Stark/Nebula for no reason whatsoever but a plot device and to push the agenda of Captain Marvel being the most powerful. Just knows that Tony is stranded in an infinite void of space to save him at the last minute.",-1
"I was a dc fan way over marvel, i actually didn't like their movies, but the last couple of years it turned around,this is the 2nd maybe best movie i have seen in the theater",1
"I was definitely disappointed with this after watching Infinity War. Thanos who was a great, very well developed villain was turned into another bland emotionless sludge. The forced girl power narratives were also an eye roll. Fat Thor was ridiculous, coupled with all of the sob stories. However there were definitely redeeming qualities about this movie. They explained the time travel very well and somewhow out of all the characters I thought Hawkeye was the best.",-1
"I was expecting a lot from the Endgame, it is a culmination of many years of MCU movies, and the plot of this movie just added more questions to the ones I had when Infinity War ended. Too many plot holes, but hopefully it can be explained in the next phase of MCU.",-1
"i was hesitant to give it a 5 or 6. after all its another braindead avengers movie by the same lazy hollywood studios that take their fan base for granted. a few nice moments in the movie, like the new hulk and thor scenes, but in generate stupid as **** as any other avengers movie. but i did give it a 6 in the end instead of a 5 just to celebrate the fact that this **** slide of MCU cringe movies is over. Cant wait for captain marvel to lead the MCU moving forward to a complete different league in the future of stupid ass ****ery that will ultimately make this crap MCU lineup seem like classic gold standards in comparison.",-1
"I was ready for anything walking into Endgame, and while the towering 3+ hour run time was daunting, and the seemingly insurmountable pressure to outperform Infinity War, I had reservations. The cold-open to the film impressed me. Normally, there is bravado, fireworks, showcasing; this was the Russo's cherry on top of the 11 years of cakes after all. The opening scene set the tone and reminded me of what was lost, and followed up with the plain text title card of the movie. I thought it was immaculate, much like a lot of the ""moments"" in this movie. One thing that cannot be overlooked is that this is very much a finale. It's tying up all the loose ends that need to get sealed off, and it's non-traditional in the sense that it is essentially a victory lap for most of these characters. So in that sense, this movie is not so much a ""movie"", rather than a series of ""moments"", and I'll explain a bit on that. Some of the most impactful scenes resonated with me even several hours after the movie ended. When Cap confidently picked up Mjolnir and joined Thor in beating the crap out of Thanos with his half-broken shield - the audience collectively and audibly gasped. When a broken Thor tearfully stumbled over himself trying to save his mother, and she (accepting her fate) tells him that it's not for her to know. Piper tearfully telling Tony that he gets to rest, after the life from him slips away, following his heroic Thanos-dusting snap from his own gauntlet. The theater was so silent and the emotion was visceral. I could go on and on, but there are simply so many good moments in this film, it's impossible to detail them all without spending 3+ hours talking about them. The ending of the movie was predictable, but very much appropriate. It was safe, and the perfect end for Tony and Cap. Though maybe not as gravitas impactful as some of the other moments in the movie, it did remind me something that the entire series of MCU movies has preached to us: It's the journey that matters, not the destination. Endgame was a symphony of incredible moments, each hero stood out and showed they belonged - and in a cast this large, an incredible feat! I won't be rushing back to the theater to watch this again, not because the movie was bad - but because it was so completely satisfying. Like a traditional home-cooked Thanksgiving dinner, this movie left me without room for dessert, and I think that is perfectly fine. The only criticism the film is guilty of is shoe-horning social narratives in. I would have preferred to see a more organic relationship develop between the female heroes, instead of just throwing in a gratuitous ""she's got help"" and then arbitrarily grouping literally every single female cast member together who have seemingly not even met each other before. It felt extremely cliche, extremely trite and out of place in a movie that went out of it's way to explain a lot of complexities and give solid reasoning behind all of it's other decisions. The only other faux pas I can flag on this film is removing the emotion from the final Thanos fight. Plucking a Thanos who hasn't even found a single Infinity stone from history and making him face our heroes who have literally been morally and physically beaten by him, felt lackluster. Seeing Scarlet Witch just pouring out raw emotion and to have it met with ""I don't even know who you are!"" while comedic, fell flat with me. Thanos only realized that he ""won"", by getting all of the stones and snapping away half of the universe. He had no knowledge of the sacrifice or pain he personally inflicted on every single person in this movie and that was one moment that we will never get to see. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride and I'm happy to see a true end to this fantastic series. It'll be difficult to rise to the heights of this again, and it's likely not something we will see again for another couple decades. So for now, enjoy the journey.",1
"I was really amazed to see this movie cater so heavily to long term fans. The number of callbacks to past Marvel movies and scenes was so impressive. 22 movies and almost all of them fed into this conclusion. As you might expect the number of characters appearing was really fantastic as well.There were moments when I was on the verge of air punching or realised my hands were clasped together in prayer. I laughed, I cried and I left the theater with an enormous sense of appreciation for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thank you to all the people who made this movie possible :).",1
"I was somewhat disappointed with Endgame. Following on from the epic that was Infinity war; which coupled action sequences with emotive dramatic scenes, the time-travel arcs in Endgame were peppered with too much slapstick-esque comedy and a lot of unnecessary fan service scenes.",-1
I was there at the beginning as Iron Man took flight for the fist time. I was there for the first Avengers I was there for Infinity War and everything in between. But the ending felt... hollow. It was funny it was even emotional but something was... off. It did not work. There was some forced stuff I will not get into and a ton of things that did not make any sense. The ending of the movie is a set up for things to come but it feels eerily similar to what happened in the comics industry. Good characters got destroyed and mediocrity took over in the name of misguided agendas.You can judge it best for yourself but I can't help but feel as if they could have done a lot better.,-1
"I wasn't expecting much based on the Trailers and I was still dissappointed. Infinity War was a great movie so it would have been better to just end it there because in order to bring back all their cashcows they came up with the most contrieved time travel plot I have ever seen. These things rarely work in movies and this time is no exception.But even if you turn your brain off at the stupidity of the plot there is very little left to this film. Most of it boils down to ""Member this, guys?"" moments that don't really add anything that we didn't already know to most characters and in some cases ruin them completely(Thor). Also, you can easilly remove about 60 minutes of this movie and it would actually be improved as much of it consists of characters trying to convince other characters to ""just do it"". We know that they eventually will, so why spend that much time on it?How's the action? Boring and devoid of tension. Also, in very small doses. Other the the final battle, that looks like the cutscene of some gereic video game from 10 years ago, there are very few action scenes. How are the visuals? Like most Marvel Movies, cheap and bland.And finally, for the characters, the thing these movies are most praised for? Let's just say that the character who gets the most satisfying arc in the series is freaking Nebula. I guess Cap sendoff is alright, Tony's sacrifice could have been great if there was any buildup to it. the Hulk is still a joke and Thor? Well, after many movies of development where he needs to learn to be a good king he realizes that he just needs to be himself, a fat, drunken slob and leave What's Her Face from Ragnarok to lead Asgard. Truly the best ending to a series ever!",-1
"I watched this movie at a 30% faster speed and it still felt long, boring, and drawn out. There are a few decent action scenes, but the movie never hits a stride. If you have enough time to waste, it is good enough to see how every thing turns out, but not much more than that.",-1
"I won't get into too many details since this movie has been reviewed a zillion times already.  It was a nice conclusion to the series, it checked off all the boxes, all the Marvel franchise characters got their moment, even though some were featured more than others, and it had a bittersweet and poignant ending  Was it great?  No, for me it was just very good.  There weren't any really suspenseful moments where I was thinking, oh my God, how will they get out of this one?!  Everything played out very predictably, and because they had to cram so much into three hours, the story was always rushing to the next thing before you could finish digesting the last thing.  Lots of great humor though, a final cameo by the late great Stan Lee, a beer belly Thor, CGI Michael Douglas from 1970, and some very touching moments, particularly with Stark and Hawkeye in scenes with their loved ones.  Captain America's epilogue was also very sweet.  The big battle near the end was visually spectacular, but as with many big special effects battles, just way too busy to make sense out of most of what's happening. Sensory overload.  And it was over almost as soon as it started.  Still, Endgame is a solid and worthwhile finish to the series, while not entirely amazing as a standalone film.",1
"I would have given it a 9 or a 10 if it were not for the feminist agenda. There were plenty of scenes showing strong capable women throughout the film and I loved them. what I did not love, was the power puff girls scene at the end.",1
I'd rather have bamboo shoots stuck underneath my fingernails than sit through that movie again.,-1
"If you aren't a Marvel fan, this movie will not change you into one. It is a predictable, boringly long mess of fan service. Especially the characters are all like one another (the funny cool ""chad"") and don't go through any character arc. Some fans tell me that they do, but over the course of tens of movies. And that is not a good thing. The only interesting character, Thanos, was completely bland in Endgame. Instead of giving him some more screen time, we got selfie jokes, Fortnite jokes, other childish jokes. I get that this movie is for all the 9 year olds out there, nothing wrong with that. But making such a hype out of it... The hype is not worth it.",-1
"If you look at the past of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; 11 years, 22 films, all leading up to Avengers: Endgame, one can definitely make the argument that this is one of the most ambitious films in human history. As someone who loves all sorts of movies, I do not make this statement lightly. To keep this as concise and spoiler-free as possible, this movie subverted my expectations in major ways, and I was not disappointed. I was grinning like a fool through the entire three hour runtime. There are some minor hiccups, but honestly, so much is tied up so nicely in this film, and Endgame will be a gold standard that epics measure themselves for years to come.",1
"If you saw the previous films then you'll watch this one. There's alot not to like though: 1. Iron Man can create a glove to use the infinity stones? Where did he learn that? 2. Time travel left so many loose ends and problems with the timeline. I didn't buy the fact that this is really how time travel works and you can't understand it. Cop-out. 3. So many characters handling stones that not even the Collector or Celestials would touch!! 4. Enemies in the sequel appear to be much weaker for no reason, but maybe that's my imagination.",-1
"If your angry about spoilers, its already spoiled... The movie is predictable... Only part that wasn't is when Thor comes back into the picture... It's three long hours of boredom...Only thing that offsets me from rating lower is the visuals and sound quality where spot on... Even then I almost walked out on this one...The move is 2/3 of the cast feeling sorry for themselves and the last 1/3 is them actualy doing something about it... There, that's the movie. Was a waste of my time and money...",-1
I'm 100% a marvel fanboy but this film is far from the movie I had in mind. I had great expectations.,-1
"I'm disappointed. The script is poor. A few characters are absurdly marginalized, others were forced into the plot. There are clear inconsistencies. The ending is rushed.",-1
I'm interested in this amazing blockbuster movie from MCU.In the end of the line this is a good endgame for marvel...,1
"I'm keeping it short. Very enjoyable movie with lots of humor, tying up the Avengers storyline started in 2008. Not as exciting as Infinity War, but definitely a worthy ending.The movie takes a slower pace compared to Infinity War, as this entry focusses more on the characters and their story arcs. Time travel is introduced (so prepare to suspend your sense of disbelief even more) to go back in time, get the Infinity Stones and bring back everyone who got snapped away! And this concludes in a last, EPIC fight scene. It's really all i have to say. It's a fantastic movie. I give it a 9/10.",1
"I'm not a comic book person, but I've enjoyed some of the MCU movies. Number one, in my book, was the first IF movie. I was surprised that Marvel made something with some true stakes. I also appreciated how the wove so many plotlines into a cohesive and entertaining movie. It flew byford me. This installment, in the other hand, dis not. The first half of the movie dragged. Sure there were some high points, but few and far  between. And I figured out the plot very quickly. It certainly wasn't bad, but it did not live up to the first installment for me. In the end, I was disappointed.",-1
"Im not a Marvel´s Superheroe movies fan,even though I have seen almost all their movies... but still I find this movie a great one. It was better than I expected.",1
"I'm not entirely sure how to start this review. I've taken some time after seeing the movie to sit on it and reflect on it to see if my initial opinions on it would change, but I still stand by what I said the instant I walked out of the theater. This is without a doubt the greatest superhero movie of all time, and arguably the best movie of all time in general.   Now, part of that opinion comes from the fact that I have sat by the series since 2012 (yeah, I jumped on a little late, sue me) and have been invested in these characters from the original Avengers. Each little detail that they threw into this movie to callback to other movies struck a chord with me because these movies are such a huge part of my life. Only someone truly invested in the characters of a story can be reduced to sobbing by a conversation about cheeseburgers.   Every scene in this movie was expertly designed to fill you with a sense of elation. You can't help but gape at the beauty of some shots, you can't help but cry in the huge moments of emotion, you can't help but laugh at the little things. This movie was designed in a way that it can only be enjoyed after multiple viewings, because you will miss something the first time, and maybe even the second time, because there is just so much stuff shoved into this movie.   From the opening scene of Hawkeye losing his family to the final goodbye to Cap after he gets his dance with Peggy after years of believing she was lost to him forever, you are filled with a sense of awe and wonder. This movie makes you realize just how much you care about these characters, even if you didn't realize it already.   There are two sequences in particular that made this movie stand out to me. There is the part where they are all in the past, going through their previous mishaps, giving these movies a last hurrah, and it just works so well. It was such a fun, nerdy sequence that you can't help but enjoy it.   The other is (shocker) the final battle. What felt like a ten minute explosion of beauty is actually a forty minute epic. We watch as Thanos makes quick work of all our heroes, leaving only Cap. The shot of Cap standing alone against the army is easily my favorite cinematic shot of all time. But then the portals open, and we finally see the scope of this universe. We finally see just how big the world is, and how many characters we have fallen in love with over time. It is one of the most powerful moments in all of cinema.   The fight that ensues is one of the most chaotic, yet perfect battle I have ever seen. And the way it all ends with the Avengers fighting Thanos for the stones, just as in Infinity War, is amazing. This time, Thanos isn't victorious, but only at the loss of one of the greatest characters of all time.   The way Tony is said goodbye to, first from Rhodey, then Spiderman, then Pepper is incredibly powerful. The funeral that ensues and the dreaded cheeseburger scene left not a single dry eye in the theater.   This is truly a masterpiece that was made by people who truly care about these characters, their craft, and making a good movie. We have so much to thank the Russos for, and we should all go see Endgame again. If you haven't seen it yet, watch it. You won't regret it.",1
"I'm sorry this movie was good, but it left the MCU in pieces.You've killed off Iron Man, given the Shield to a man whose not a super soldier, in so doing took away one of the coolest heroes you had (Falcon), then you sacrificed Black Widow with no clear replacement for her either.They barely used professor hulk during the fight scenes and I think everyone was looking forward to a Hulk vs Thanos fight.  Anyway, you have War Machine still around, but no mastermind to upgrade the tech or repair it when it gets damaged (as it often does).The point is, I don't see a clear path forward here for the MCU and all I can see going forward are a series of individual movies without any further Avengers films.I'm on the edge between 6 and 7 for a rating, because it wasn't horrible, but it was the end of this universe as I see it.",0
"In a word ""Boring"". What a waste of time! this movie shows all the superheros in their old fragile state and then they eventually die. Everybody is crying, being sad, depressed and dramatic for almost 3 hours. By no means anybody can tell that this is an action movie.Thor was humiliated beyond any tolerable limits. Marvel has Faded all the actor's powers (HULK,THOR) and killed few(IRON MAN, Captain America, Black widow) and humiliated others (THOR). Its definitely not exciting to see captain america swinging Thor's hammer.When they get back in time to save the world they made the movie worst. This time travel thing is used when movie makers can't form a proper story. Overall, this was the worst Marvel movie ever made. Never watch this director's & writer's movie ever again. I know i won't.",-1
"In itself the movie is really good and the final is very satisfactory. However, the time travels and the fantasy that result with other realities, leaves many holes in the movie. Despite that, shutting down the brain won't be so hard after all, there are emotions and mixed feelings that mitigate the field of science fiction that the Avengers entered.",1
"In order to fully appreciate this heart warming and tear jerking 3 hour epic, I'd recommend rewatching all the other dozen or so Marvel feature films! Truly mind-blowing special effects and excellent acting, in particular from Robert Downey Jr, RIP, however slightly undermined by forced upon Identity Politics and a be-muddled and confused plot, with the excessive use of time travel not helping to ease more casual viewers into a wider experience. All in all, a good movie and a satisfying ending.",0
"In Russos I had faith and they did deliver once again. The sheer scale of how this movie depicts the finale to the decade-old franchise with its actions sequences and CGI is worth a watch atleast twice on the big screen. It packs itself with humor,emotions, drama and thrill that makes the viewers drool for more even after the credits roll. The characters associated with this one gets their fair share of screen space to complement the cohesivness of the film's plot. The humor unlike typical bathos that plagues most of the MCU movies finds perfect landing at almost every points and those riveting actions scenes coupled with perfectly timed money-shots ramp everything up as true fan service. The Russos clearly deserve a loud applause for having graced the brand with their special touch.This definitely gave that 'The Return of the King' vibe that I had back then and would go down personally as the best MCU movie followed by Winter Soldier, again coming from the Russos.",1
"In short not as good as infinity war.Cons:There is a bit of the new disney ""SJW"" signalling going on this this movie, one scene in particular beats you over the head with ""Woman power"" completely taking you out of the moment.Scenes that should naturaly of been sad or epic were massivly overwrought to the extent that they were basicly telling you what you should be feeling, rather than generating the emotion itself.The ""big"" action scene was hugely overdone, way too many charatcers for one scene which left it feeling like a Transformers battle where you cant quite tell whats happening.The third act was substantialy worse than the first two.The storyline was laughable compared to infinity war, with fairly massive plot holes and logic leaps.Thanos lost everything that made him an interesting villain.Pros:Some good use of comedy in the first and second actSome of the visuals were very goodSome memorable scenes, especialy during the ""dopelganger"" scenes.Good time travelling mechanics.Suprising movie opening.Overall its a definite watch if your a fan of the series, just dont get your expectations up to high as this wouldnt even rank in my top 5 Marvel films.",-1
"In short, while the movie was very enjoyable and had it's golden moments of fan service, there were many things in this movie that prevented it from being a completely fulfilling conclusion to the franchise.I'm just going to list off everything this movie did right, and everything this movie did wrong and leave it at that;WHAT WENT RIGHT;- Unpredictability- Fan Service- Final Battle- Use of different method of time travel- Halkeye's family in the beginning- Not making Captain Marvel an absolute core to the movie since she only got recently introduced- Special effects- Good character closure (except Cap returning as an old man wasn't exactly necessary, and it would have been sweeter and more dramatic if he simply left with Peggy without a trace).WHAT WENT WRONG- Doesn't truly make sure of the 3 hour run time; a lot of it is empty or could have definitely be used for building up the ending more.- Very uneven pacing- Tries to be too funny and casual at times when humour and being casual is the exact opposite of what is necessary- Doesn't focus enough on the truly devastating affects of the snap enough to invoke anger, fear and hopeless into the audience- Hulk's character got completely butchered and side-lined- Thor being fat and a loser was unpredictable and funny for the first while, but a big mistake in the long run since it made all his scenes too funny and awkward- Quantun Realm Deus Ex Machina (it would have been cooler if Dr. Strange did send the Time Stone to the future for the Avengers to study and invent time travel tech from)",0
Indescribable...:)I just loved it.Best super hero movie with no doubt.epic!!!,1
"Infinity War is a better movie overall but Endgame is the definitive conclusion to the 11-year story arc. The amazing character interactions in this movie alone are worth the watch. The story is very simple, but the way they pull off the ""snap reversal"" is beautiful. It ends on a high note, even if it does get a bit confusing with all the time-travel/alternative universe plot holes that arise toward the end of the movie. And I got to see my favorite superhero in the entire MCU do something magical. He started this with ""I am Iron Man"" and he got to end it with that admission to Thanos, who was immediately rendered speechless by it. What a beautiful character arc. It's definitely a 10/10 in my book but for objectivity's sake, I'm going to leave it at 8/10.",1
"Infinity War was a 10 for me...this was a 4.  Too many long & drawn out scenes.  Some jokes they took too far or went to the well too many times..THOR cough cough...Everyone will praise this film, I think it kinda sucked.",-1
"Infinity War was a wonderful epic film yet this doesn't feel like it is written or directed by the same people.They 'cleansed' Thor and Hulk of their toxic masculinity making them literally laughing stocks. From IW when Thor had an amazing journey, he is just embarrassing in this. And Hulk whose MO is losing his **** and smashing things up is suddenly all touchy feely - what the hell. It's almost like there is some kind of agenda in needing to clip the wings of the old guard before the next phase.The time travel feels silly and gimmicky and nothing more than self indulgent fan service. They effectively ape IW by having the Avengers go on a stone search just like Thanos did in IW. It makes scenes such as that on Vormire have little or no tension because we saw it all in the other film.Tony and Steve's arc doesn't get any decent closure with Tony reverting to the self absorbed douche bag that he was when the series started and Steve being his effective verbal whipping boy. All the efforts to make Thanos engaging and empathetic are cast aside so that the journey we saw him go on in IW is just thrown in the trash and we are given the 2014 Thanos who is just a cardboard cut out evil bad guy. This isn't the guy that we saw in IW who made the sacrifice on Vormire and could empathise with Scarlet Witch.For no reason whatsoever, he has decided against his life goal of a 50% cull of the universe to complete annihilation of everything even though he hasn't had the opportunity to experience the 'fruits' of his cull. He is also now ridiculously over powered. In IW, Stormbreaker nearly kills Thanos when he has all six stones yet in Endgame, he has no stones or gauntlet and Thor can't mortally damage him with Stormbreaker AND Mjolnir.I've seen many try to dismiss these as easily explainable plot holes but the reality is that they are just lazy writing and pretentious directing. Seemingly the makers got themselves into a hole with a fearsome yet sympathetic bad guy, cooked up a time travel device that created nothing but a slew of contradictions, removed the straight line linearity of IW, invested all the money in a final battle that looked like an over inflated DC mess rather than matching the clear and beautifully simple fights/battles from IW and felt the need to hobble some of the biggest characters to signal their social justice virtue.This disappointment of a film which must rank as the Russo's worst MCU film smacks of what happened with Joss Whedon and the Ultron film. Too much pressure and studio meddling , straight jacketed by a dose of political correctness and a loss of stand out creativity to be patched over with fan pleasing guff.Given the Russo's previous stellar work, I expected this to be sure fire hit but what I got was a hot mess of a film that tried to tie things up but rendered itself a little vanilla in doing so. What a wasted opportunity , what a sad end to what had been a glorious 10 years and what a disappointing follow on from the fabulous Infinity War.",-1
Infinity wars was so much better. This was not a bad movie but also not good either. The action parts are pretty cool but otherwise it was a long boring movie,-1
Is goodThe go back in time is too old scholltoo many things on the screen at.the same timeBut iron man end was good,0
"It can feel a little odd to watch a movie for three hours without missing out on some critical details that can affect the movie in many different ways, but that would honestly be a lie if I would say that just to bring this film down. Marvel has built its world filled with iconic superheroes that we adore starting with Iron Man back in 2008 and now twenty-one films later, we're now seeing what is literally going to be the most epic final battle in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Avengers: Endgame does not disappoint me when it came to telling its story during the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War and it shouldn't do the same thing to you too. You can easily tell that this is the most carefully detailed Marvel Cinematic Universe movie out of the rest of them and they put their best efforts of care into it resulting in a movie that feels more than just your average superhero movie. Definitely give this one a watch if you want to find a movie that feels more like an adventure than just a movie because you're basically not going to regret the ride.",1
"It feels and watches like a seasin finale of a series. You don't expect it to be good. You expect certain thing to happen. They happen. And it's not good. This picture is about 4 of the avengers. The rest is not important and non-existent. Tip for Disney: when you hype different, fake plots to keep the real one secret, try to make this real one better then the fakes...",-1
It is a perfect film. For a long time i didn't had so big range off emotions from a single film.,1
It is a ten year build with ten years of plot holes that pile up. The most notably happen when a lot of Age of Ultron plot points are forgotten and characters lose abilities and information for Thanos to be a threat. The humor in this movie is too overpowering considering the situation. How they did Thor and Hulk dirty was a major turn off. This movie didn't live up to the hype. The last 30 minute is good but then you are left with mainly plotholes in that fight as everyone waits their turn while dispatching easy killable villains and disappearing air support that ignores enemy ships for Captain Marvel. The whole run the gauntlet is stupid considering they have an army of teleporting sorcerers who can also just teleport Thanos to pieces or just drop him into the upper atmosphere. Hulk doesn't redeem himself from his lacklust performance in Infinity War.,-1
"It is a worst possible face of the commercial in history, end of a story!!!",-1
"It is all about fan-service and trying to make you cry. But when it comes to watching a good movie, it fails.",-1
It is an amazing film with everything you want and more it has some fun action scenes and some amazing scenery it is one heck of a film and  will shape the future of the MCU.,1
"It is clearly a movie aimed for fan service . It takes the old guard and say goodbye . Any loyal fan who sat for 20+ movies get rewarded as we are bombarded to references from other movies  and Easter eggs. It almost requires an extended cut of 4/5 hours as there is barely anytime for character development. You actually wonder what was the fuss with Capt Marvel . She is way over powered compared to the rest of the heroes . You really can't relate to her . It feels like a DC character that was just slingshot  into the MCU .She is just a blunt weapon and I still don t understand her power. She is as attractive  as the hammer she plays. How does she navigate space , found the lost in space heroes at the beginning , where was she for 5 years (??), how do they contact her when they need her and how long she takes to travel. The main issue with managing so many stories , so many characters and so many time line is plot holes.....And there is so many it is mind blowing .There is enough spoiler online so i won t drag but the quantum realm affecting Janet Pym but not Scott Lang the same way , killing your old self and still standing ?, disappearing for 5 years and going back to your life like nothing happened and no one aged ( that may be addressed on the next movie tho), consistency with previous movies while time jumping etc.... I guess the movie stay with you long after you finish watching it '",-1
"It is good closure for this saga of 22 films a great homage to Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. that started this whole thing up, a well managed to a certain point plot about time travel that has its plot holes without which you couldn't justify more than one event in the movie, the most commonly complained aspects I've watched are Professor Hulk, fat Thor and the scene of just superheroines, and they're not bad those have a justification among some other things like several deus ex machinas, the third act is super epic and it's fan service well done not like Batman V Superman where is poorly executed but it is not enough for me to be a better movie in general than Infinity War. More than the plot holes or the ridiculousness of the jokes what I disliked the most was how impertinent they were with the product placement, a commercial for Fortnite, a commercial for Axe and the most brazen of all the Audi one, its clear they gave more priority to other things that make it a coherent film with cinematographic arguments.",1
"It is quite a moving and funny movie.I still prefer Avengers: Infinity War because of how epic and dynamic it was, but even so this is still a good conclusion to the Infinity Saga.",1
It is unfortunately but not unexpected that they would drop the ball at the end. There are simply too many characters and the story is quite boring and messed up.,-1
It kinda feels like they phoned it in this time around along with Captain Marvel being an objectively **** **** hero due to her powers. I dont know it just didnt feel right in the slightest in comparison to infinity war.,-1
"It pales in comparison to Infinity War, but Endgame is still entertaining, emotional, action-packed and a satisfying conclusion to the MCU.",0
"It sucked not majorly, but kinda does in the beginning. The time traveling makes no actual sense and contradicts everything in the movie. Only a few of the scenes in the movie and the large battle near the end it the on;y memorable parts. Overall one of the worst Marvel movies ever made with too many plot holes.",-1
"It was a good movie for sure, but not great. I think found the biggest issues it faced were that they just have too many big characters in the Avengers that you simply can't do justice to them all - credit where credit is due they did pretty well. In fairness they did focus heavily on the older characters, and rightly so, however it missed an opportunity to do more with the newer ones as a result. Also Capt Marvel is way to over powered. I was also hoping for more of a feel good ending, this is why we watch these movies right? Anyway all in all it was a good run, but not as good as its predecessors in my opinion.",0
"It was an OK movie. Dialogue and character interactions were good, time travel was established quite well and referances were great. However the movie was just a fan service composed of moderate drama and comedy. The MVP were Nebula, Nat, Clint and Tony. Steve was OK and got a somewhat decent ending. Hulk was mediocre and Thor was straight trash. Overall, movie was boring and too much over-hyped. Storytelling was nowhere near Infinity War and plot was nothing extraordinary. Thanos became a casual Marvel villain unlike his counterpart in Infinity War. This time he had no depth, minimal emotion and an unimpressive arc. My score is 5/10. Mostly because of how well Russo's dealt with time travel and our lesser hero got moments to shine. Unfortunately rest of the heroes were uninteresting and useless.",-1
"It was an okey movie but it really dropped the ball at the ending.1. Tony Stark dies, i can accept it but.... They have all infinity stones + Hugo Strange that can heal any wounds with the time stone so his death made no sense.2. Thanos lost in a unfair match against Team Space in the last movie but in this one hes able to compete with everyone, even Thor that (might been out of shape) had both mjolnir and stormbreaker that could oneshot kill him.3. Mary Sue Marvel had no place in this movie, it hurt every moment she was on the screen.and at the ending where she came in saved everyone and could tank thanos attacks that beat the hulk into a coward because ""gurl power"". Really hoped she would die in this movie.4. Timetravel works if its parallell universes but Captain America deciding to stay in the past for some coochi was pretty bloody dumb and somehow still end up in the main time line?5. Thor giving the reigns to a random valkyrian. Thor is of noble blood and is suppose to sit on the throne, he cant just give it to a random valkyrian that havent been in asgard for over a million years. Would make more sense if he adopted earths democratic voting system instead.6. The girl power moment was cringe and out of place, and the scientist from black panther would have 100% died in a real war. 7. How did Ant-man survive a rocket that could destroy a whole house to the face?But the movie was still okey, but i think this will be the last avenger movie i will ever watch and just keep following Spider-man movies in the future.",-1
"It was far too long (for the last hour and a half i was hoping it would just end already), a lot of cringey geek moments (camera stares when a character shows up that you forgot about, happens about 20 times, stupid catch phrases from previous movies), tried wayyyy too hard to be serious and sad (its a comic book movie, just make it fun), the sound track was meh at best and lastly and most importantly you saw Jeremy Renner’s atrocious haircut wayyyyy too much.",-1
"It was just generally okay. It was going pretty well until about midway into the movie and then all of a sudden a bunch of plot holes start popping up all the way to the end. It's still a pretty decent movie, but I was really disappointed with the ending. They really ruined Thanos who was an amazing character in Infinity War and felt like a completely different character in this movie. I'm sure by now everyone knows they use time travel, and unfortunately as most films that use time travel it just didn't work out well. Without revealing too much, they could of made it work but they started digging  their own holes. Anyways, worth seeing but very meh. Doesn't come close to Infinity War.",0
"It was just Okay. Certainly entertaining but not anywhere as good as Infinity War. There are some good notes. Some great dialogue and action-sequences. The overall plot is pretty solid. Buuuuuuuut, the pacing is sluggish and choppy. After the first hour, I found myself wondering when the movie would actually start. I got bored. I've never gotten bored watching an MCU movie before! Some of the character design choices were not well-explained or executed. You are made to accept that 'These well-established character(s) are suddenly different and like this now'. I guess the writers thought the events from the prior movie would be good enough but I think that is lazy and insufficient. I'm glad I saw it but I don't think I will feel inclined to watch it ever again.",-1
"It was pretty good, then it got pretty bad, then it got good again, and then a little bit much... overall decent...",-1
"It was really good...maybe great as superhero films go.  But, too damn long and absurd misuse of Thor and especially Hulk.  And arrow guy gets way to much screen time.  I mean, he shoots arrows for Christ's sake.  What good is that guy, really?",1
"It was slow at the beginning but as we hit the point in the movie the drove everyone to work together it turned into the movie we all deserved, in the climax of the movie it was what the fan had deserved to see and allowed us to get the conclusion that the Infinity Saga deserved",1
"It was very disappointing sequel and bad conclusion of MCU saga. It did not meet expectation and hype. Time travel thing is dumb, they can't even explain how it works so they use use ""quantum physics"" as an explanation.In Infinity war, Iron man and Doctor Strange fought against Thanos on their own very well, and Thanos even had 5 infinity stones. But in Endgame, 3 powerful avengers could not fight against Thanos with no ifninity stone. Why is Thanos's strength such inconsistent?In the scene where Hulk meets Ancient one, Hulk asks where Doctor Strange is. Ancient one says Hulk is 5 years early and Doctor Strange hasn't become wizard yet. She knew Strange would become wizard. It contradicts with Doctor Strange movie, because in that movie Ancient one was refusing to teach Strange about sorcery, she only did it because Mordo convinced her.It also doesn't explain how did Captain return 6 stones. How can he travel to Vormir, Asgard and other planets? If he stayed in the past to live with Peggy, why is he, the old version of himself, is in the original timeline? Like these above, this movie has many unexplained plotholes and contradictions.And the scene where all female superheroes gathering in the same place is very cringe and forced. Because it doesn't make any sense. There is battle happening everywhere, everyone is busy. There is no any convenient time for gathering. And why is Gamora even there? She came from 2014, she doesn't even know any of these people. Did she think ""Hey looks like there are female heroes are gathering maybe I should go there too""?Avengers endgame is overrated and disappointing movie, and Infinity war was 10 times better.",-1
It wasn't clear who returned from the time ttravel Capitan America  or Steve Rogers? ???,0
It wasn't that good of a movie. It didn't have enough action. I don't know why people are saying this movie is that good. I also didn't think it was that funny.,-1
"It’s exactly what you want from a Marvel movie, while also having heartbreaking emotional moments as well. The only problem with this movie is how the screenwriters completely butchered Thanos’ character like a dirty animal. He went from an understanding, realistic villain to a generic bad guy who wants to destroy everything in his path for no reason. It’s not the best movie of the year, or even the best COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF THE YEAR, but it will be looked upon as a classic in the future.",1
"It's a bit confusing at first but once you really delve deeper and let yourself be engrossed in the story, you start to understand and enjoy it.",1
"It's a bit slow in the first hour, a bit of a mess in the second, yet ultimately triumphant and incredible to watch unfold in the third hour. It will make you chuckle, maybe even pull at your heart strings as it pokes and plays with the past as it reaches its conclusion... But it nonetheless certainly drags before you ever get there... Call me crazy, or just plain greedy, but I had a bit more fun with the singular hero in Shazam! earlier this month.",0
"It's a good conclusion to a 21 movie saga.  It's not perfect, a little longer than it needs to be, but it's a very enjoyable film.  A trip down memory lane of 10 years of marvel movies.",1
"It's a good send off for the original Avengers' cast. There was no way to live up to the standard of Infinity War, but they did a great job nonetheless. The world building and the plot are good. Some plot elements might come in and bite them in the bottom in future movies, but for now, it's alright. Thanos is not nearly as well written as he was, which is disappointing. Overall it's a very good movie.",1
It's a little to long in the beginning but great middle and ending. I would like to know what's next. This movie is something that need another Sequel,1
"It's a necessary movie to continue with the franchise, otherwise Infinity War would be sufficient as an ending, still pretty awesome.",1
"It's a really good movie ! I enjoyed it so much, there is nothing bad in this movie but i would give it a 10 if the content was deeper",1
It's fantastic movie against all marvel movies. Characters show's their best performance in this one. Keep it up marvel studio...,1
"It's in my opinion the worst marvel movie I've seen and I've seen all except for the captian marvel movie. I loved the previous avengers movie, which I rated 9 out of 10. I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time.We need better ending to all these years of loyalty. So many things in this movie are unreasonable. This movie needs to be snapped out of existence...",-1
"It's not just the hype that ruined this movie. Without the hype and just by looking at it for how it was written, you can tell that it's filled with plotholes.",-1
"It's really good. They've done what needed to be done to conclude the saga, abandoning the usual cheesy ways superhero's movies end, and makes you understand that all Marvel movies til now were made in prior to this movie. I still prefer Infinity War over Endgame for being packed with more action (and badass) scenes, as Endgame is slower paced. But in a much more real sense, you'll love this either way, I saw people cry, laugh and shock themselves on the session. It's worth every penny and every second.",1
"It's sad that the only thing that was memorable for me in this movie was that final fight with Thanos. Other than that, all the other scenes were either incomprehensible or just plain boring.",1
"It's sad to see that Marvel ""fans"" are hating on this film and not even trying to understand why this film is different from the flashy, action-packed, Avengers film that we've gotten so used to. The aftermath of Infinity War left a scar on each of the remaining heroes. That's what they're dealing with here, not some giant robot or intergalactic force out to destroy the world.",0
It's the best movie i ever seen in my life. Wow!!! Congrats to th Russo's. I hope it's not the last one.,1
It's the Endgame. Nuff' Said. I was happy with it. It is unlike probably anything else in cinematic history. The last hour of this film alone is just what I lived for as a kid.,1
"It's the hype that kills you.......after Marvel took some brave risks with IW which gave provided the film with substance and emotional gravitas, they directors, unsurprisingly, chose to unwind all of that and essentially, with the exception of the death of Iron Man, return everything to the status quo (yawn). The most interesting character from IW was Thanos, who, rarely for a Marvel villain, had a clear motive and was an emotionally complex character whose obsession with his own destiny destroyed everything he loved, in the name of 'saving' the universe. Interesting stuff. So do the writers do? they kill him off in the first few minutes, only to bring him back via time travel, which results in the Thanos of this film becoming another caricature of a villain; this Thanos has not been through the Trauma of sacrificing his own daughter, or through the hard graft of travelling across the galaxy to acquire the infinity stones. He's just another over-powered villain here. They should have found a more creative way to make the 'original' Thanos a viable threat, which would have forced the writers to come up with a more imaginative way of tackling Thanos for the second time, instead of using brute force in (another) final battle sequence. The humour was pitched at just the right level in IW, there's even more of it here and as such the film is tonally confused and feels more like Thor:Ragnarok than a sequel to IW. Captain Marvel is also grossly underused, especially after the not-so-subtle hint and the end of that film that she was going to play a part in Endgame. The time travel plot is incredibly inelegant and I'm still not sure on the logic that it doesn't really matter what you do in the past because it won't affect the future anyway? It was a device solely used to revisit some of the old Marvel movies, which is shameless fan service but I'm not necessarily against fan service and I'm sure it was a fun nostalgia trip for a lot of people. The filmmakers also do not really explore what life is like on Earth post Thanos' eradication of half of life on the planet - yes it's quieter and people are still sad, but there was a real chance to explore some interesting questions as to whether there was any (admittedly brutal) sense in what Thanos was trying to achieve (there is a moment where Cap comments that a pod of dolphins were seen because the rivers are less polluted due to less human traffic, but that is quickly quashed). However I appreciate most Marvel fans are not paying to see an intelligent comment on the problem of overpopulation. So what does this all add up to? an average Marvel movie where there are no real surprises or deviation from the standard formula. IW was by far a superior film but any sense of venturing into the unknown that IW established was quickly eradicated by a click of the studio's fingers.....",-1
"It's the most fun you can ever have at a Marvel movie and the Final Battle is worth the wait. The reasons  it's not getting a higher score because I believe it did have a shaky story structure, level 1 plot choices, drab cinematography, and too much fan service.",0
"It's the movie of the last ten year's. It's funny,it's fun to watch and it's a great movie after all. *but* its have a huge mistake. At ""Antman and the Wasp"" when Janet coming out of the countom world she at the same age like Hank.  When Scot getting  out the countom world he look the same age.But after all, it a good movie.",1
"It's very, very good. Endgame cashes in on all of the great moments and characters of the MCU, and makes a film unlike anything since Return of the King. One complaint is that the film starts stronger than it finishes, Captain America and Black Widow shine in the first act as we see their heart-break over Infinity War. It's incredibly moving watching a regular guy in a support group talk about his first date since Infinity War, and then hearing Cap tell him 'we gotta learn to live, otherwise Thanos should've just killed all of us.' The rest of the film is good, but not quite as moving. My only real gripes are the way that Captain Marvel and the end battle are shoe-horned in, the movie would have been just as good without either.",1
its was great but not good as infinity war but overall was a great final for the adventure franchise,0
"Jokes, fan services and nothing more. It was not worth the money from the movies. A fishery would have been better.",-1
Just **** woow ! When you're a movie director and you want a movie to learn how to put final touches just watch aveners endgame,1
"Just a megamix with all heroes and timelines, they should finish movie after cutting Tanos' head, come on, dude just was chilling in his house cooking a soup. This movie is just a fan service, not a movie itself, just pieces of some situations. I just wish Tanos could snap this dudes away again.Music in the end is a remix of Alan Silvestri's Predator (1987) movie. So, OST is dull, Captain Marvel feminized with short hairs and arrogant (she was ok in solo movie, but here).Plot holes, feminism stuff, Thor Lebowski and the return of the worst Spider-Man. RIP MARVEL, it died with Stan Lee.",-1
"Just dreadful. Almost all of this entire 3+ hour snoozefest was nothing but a weepy gaze backward at the most bloated commercial cash-extraction machine in cinematic history. Unless you are a 35-year-old man-boy with a deep-seated need to fork over money to watch a movie franchise pay tribute to itself, you'd honestly come out ahead to burn $12 then sit on your thumbs for 3 hours, staring at a blank wall.",-1
Just Gave me one reason that this movies is not a business movie that it takes us all the old school feelings and put the modern time to it ..with all my respect and lovely feelings to stan lee .. i can say 9.2 imdb i mean wtf? anythings i said anybody just say u cant compare ! a movie like (one flew over the cuckoo's nest _ forrest gump or what ever with a movie like this and i just can said its all in ure mind u made a guard for it to say its a great movie .. come on! convince me ! that its not the only movie with actions and modern makes .. they makes iron man a god for u and they killed it and u come here and say wow iron man is die and he sacrified him self! for humanity vs aliens !wow what a great point :D ! tell me that u learn more!,-1
"Just got home after a late night screening. Man... long movie, but it didn't really feel like 3 hours had passed when it came to its conclusion. I definitely got caught up in it and over all enjoyed the movie.Is it perfect? Naw, not really. I won't spoil it, but it does have a few plot holes and contrived situations. But it is based on the Marvel universe, so a person has to give it a bit of slack for that reason alone. As well a couple ""twists"" were telegraphed to such an extent that only a fool wouldn't of seen what was coming. But I was entertained so I'll overlook those minor imperfections too.Of course it was pretty well acted considering the cast, and ever actor rose to the occasion admirably. Well except for Chris Hemsworth... he stole the thing. I consider him the highlight of the whole movie and his portrayal of a ""down and out"" Thor now rivals Reynolds Deadpool for me. If for no other reason a person needs to see the movie just to watch his performance.A good flick for the target audience of which I'm one. But if you're not a big fan of the superhero genre' don't go into this one expecting it to be any different then the others we've seen. It's bigger and more bombastic, but in the end it's still the same, just in a newer and prettier frock.",0
"Just like Infinity War, i loved the movie when it came out, the more i watched it the more i saw the flaws. it is still a good movie with some great things in it and some fantastic moments if your a fan the mcu ( I am )7,5/10",0
"Just want to say that the film is quite good, but it has 2 problems, because of which the pleasure is lost when watching.Let's start with less meaningful - with one person, Brie Larson. This is an absolute misskast for a rather important (?) role. However, replacing CM with any other character would change little. All that she basically does in the film is how cool she is. Well, also earns a tug. Well, the character performed by Bree looks absolutely dead, because she has neither charisma, nor distinctive personal qualities.Okay, stop scolding Bree, because you can do this forever. The second, much more important issue of the film is an extremely weak scenario. Again, it is possible to explicate for an extremely long time what, how and why, but I’ll just say: the film introduces the possibility of traveling in time, without consequences. And this is the all-consuming ""black"" hole of the plot, because of which the meaning is lost in absolutely everything that comes through in the film. The flywheels of time compared to this is a children's toy.7/10, the film disappointed, but still allowed enough to spend an interesting 3 hours.",0
"Lets be fair we had high expectations and russos did not deliver, infinity war was way better than this. To begin they ruined thor after he got so boosted up, tons of loopholes, weak time travel plot, the only saving grace is the last fight.",-1
Loved this movie. Everybody else that's asking for more action on this film need to re-watch Infinity War and think long and hard about how much the effects of the snap can affect one's mental health. Even heroes bleed.,1
"Major plotholes, terrible pacing, long movie for no reason(could've been 2 hours easily),  Hulk is Yamcha, forced characters, crapped on Thor, many casuals didn't care for the Stan Lee cameo, cheap drama tricks, etc. Over done time travel story with plotholes. The only redeeming factors being a few decent jokes, The first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes.Extremely overhyped and really just for the casual Marvel audience. Two extra hours of lame fan service. Disappointing. If I was new to Marvel I understand why it's big but I'm not. It's generic if anything.",-1
"Man the Endgame was an incredible and fantastic movie. There was a fuuny moment during the movie. Endgame was actually better than Infinity war in my opinion. Also, there were some Women for folks, who want to take their girlfriend or wife it's was interesting. This movie illustrates, that we need to come together to stop these threats from happening.",1
"Marvel did it. He created a superhero world full of heroes who fight the negative. Endgame is already the fourth part of the well-known superhero series Avengers, which sells out cinemas, and even in this case it is no different. The famous Avengers also surpassed the great Avatar in profitability. No wonder. The excellent ending of one great Marvel saga was a success. Whether events, story, effects and the like. In short, a wonderful ending and a duty for every Marvel fan.",1
"Marvel fans, you have to come to the realization that these movies are not that great. In particular the humor. The  humor in the MCU has gotten horrible and always seems to show up when you would be experiencing something other than laughter (""I aimed for the head""). This is the primary reason I don't consider these movies to have any heart put behind them. I firmly believe that they follow a formula where there has to be a joke after a certain amount of time regardless if it kills the mood.On the  bright side, at least Thanos' goal made sense in this movie. The killing half the universe thing is stupid if you still allow what is left to reproduce, and since he had the kill set to randomize you were always going to have about a 50/50 split on the sexes. Thor, just why? He has been a pointless laughing stock since Ragnarok. Hulk was also a disappointment. If the comics are anything to go by, people in general don't like a fusion of Banner and Hulk, and generally it seemed it only existed due to the special limitation that they put into the Infinity Guantlet (which shouldn't have limitations and makes no sense to have any if Thanos was going to do with it in this movie what he wanted). If it wasn't for Downey and Thanos this time I would probably rate this movie a zero.",-1
"Marvel movies, specifically MCU movies just became really hard to review, because like I heard somewhere on the internet: This is not a movie...It's an event.Now sure, as an event it's fantastic. Full of fanservice and making every MCU fan finally getting what they always wanted makes this definitely a crowd-pleaser. I consider myself a fan of the MCU, but I'm also a fan of cinema in general...Which means that it's time to review it as an ACTUAL movie:The technical aspects are...Okay. The directing and cinematography are...Alright. I mean, they can't do much with that since almost the entire movie is CGI. Almost every shot has like a really strong depth-of-field blur that I just don't like...It makes the shots feel fake. Seriously, I don't think there is a single moment where I think that the sets look real. It's not incompetent, obviously, but the entire movie just looks so artificial. Now, props to the VFX team because, once again, they did a fantastic job, specially with Thanos, like the previous movie, but seriously, the overuse of CGI just makes everything look...Once again...Fake.Character development? What is that? There is none! Once again, just like Infinity War, with a HUGE cast of characters, it's basically impossible to give every character enough screentime and relevance to the plot and that's what happens here. Sure, you could argue that the characters have arcs and resolutions and I agree, but those arcs didn't start in this movie, started in five movies prior. There's a five year gap between Infinity War and Endgame and we just see the change of our main characters...Offscreen. That was lazy as hell, having character arcs...Offscreen. Hulk's character was the worst. We see him at the beggining being Bruce Banner, just like in the previous movie and then after the offscreen five year gap, we see him turned into Professor Hulk (or Smart Hulk whatever the hell it's called. Like, they never mention his name anyways). Literally a couple minutes passed and we see that sudden change. Things like those just seem like lazy writing. Speaking about lazy writing: Sorry but making a movie about time travel has a 99% chance of making something that doesn't make any sense or contradicts itself. Sure, we are supposed to suspend our disbelief as many MCU movies basically have the logic of a cartoon, but still, all this time travel stuff just left me wondering SOOO many things. Like, how is that you can't bring back a character that died? Didn't they established that if you take something from the past it doesn't affect your current timeline, just that timeline or some sh*t like that.The movie feels like it doesn't have a real threat throughout most of it. In the previous one we had Thanos from beggining to end. Here, we barely have Thanos. He now comes into the plot because the writers felt that they needed a big fight at the end. The way Thanos ends up appearing is just full of plot conveniences. Seriously, the writing, if you think about it, is so dumb. In the previous movie, Thanos was a very well developed villain with a clear motivation. Here, he changed his motivation and he just became the generic bad guy that just wants to destroy the universe. So lame.Of course among the genuinely positive things we have Alan Silvestri's score which might be the best score in any Avengers movie. We have the acting. This is arguably the best performance of the main cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth) in any Avengers movie ever. We have the pacing, which was really good because the movie constantly moved forward. It was three hours long but it never felt like it. It's a three hour long movie I could rewatch in its entirety at any time.Overall, as a MOVIE (in the filmmaking aspect) it is definitely a competent movie. Sure the writing is really dumb at times and the overuse of CGI might be a detriment, but pretty much the rest of the aspects are really solid. This feels like a great payoff. This feels like a satisfactory conclusion to this 22-movie franchise and the character resolutions were really well executed (even though one just makes me ask so many questions). I really enjoyed it because, like I said, I like watching MCU movies, but I need to stop wearing my fan glasses and admit the positives and negatives of the filmmaking aspect of this movie.",0
Marvel's Avengers Endgame is the perfect representation of the effort put by Marvel studios over the 10 years course. It manages to walk down the memory lane without overdoing it and its conclusion to the infinity stones saga is truly an Epic. No amount of words can describe the masterpiece created by the Russo brothers and this is truly a worthwhile must watch.,1
"Masterpiece.  One of the best big movies ever made.  Ranks with the great sequels like Empire Strikes Back and Dark Knight. The script, the direction, the performances are all devoted to making this movie special.  Endgame could have been an 8/10 and made as much money as it has.  But the fact they delivered an 11/10 shows you what these filmmakers are made of.  When it ended I immediately wanted to see it again.",1
"Masterpiece? Not at all.But it's definitely a satisfying conclusion. The movie has flaws, but there so many good things about it, especially the last chapter, i got goosebumps like never before :)I definitely recommend it!",1
"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Great movie, not without its problems, for example Captain Marvel should have been completely wrote out of this movie, she is a character written purely to appease the SJW types who dont even watch these movies, I dread to think what would have happened if she was in it anymore, her whole character takes away the merits the other characters have earned. If they wanted badass woman in this movie then they already have them.Secondly, time travel. While it was fun watching the various characters visit their pasts and revisiting past movies from different perspectives time travel is something that has been done 1000's of times and is not really an original concept, the vast amount of plot holes it leaves are just not worth it. Finally some characters are sidelined for the movies who really shouldn't be I'll let you decide for yourself who you think deserved more time.Overall this is a good movie, if it were up to me I would have done it differently really its only introducing an overpowered character ( Captain Marvel ) and time travel that really let it down, it basically nullifies the past losses and achievements of the movies and its characters as anything they have done can be so easily rectified.I give this movie a 7/10 I am not being too harsh I think this is just right for the movie, I will be 100% watching it again when it comes out of blu-ray.",0
"Most fans expected that ""Avengers: Endgame"" will resort to time travel to make everything right. It is the same idea of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Three moments made ""Avengers: Endgame"" terrific but not a masterpiece, the 1st one is killing Thanos by Thor at the beginning, 2nd one is the sacrifice of Black Widow, and the last one is the death of Iron Man, actually these three unexpected moments shocked all Avengers fans.I have also some negative comments starting with the purpose of Captain Marvel in Endgame!! Actually the only role for her is saving Iron man from a lonely death in space!! The other thing is the final battle, in my humble opinion, it was chaotic as same as White Walker battle in Game of Thrones, also the time travel was a bit hasty and unconvinced, especially in the way of retrieving the infinity stones.Anyway, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the final movie in the Avengers series, and its ending is a good way to say goodbye.",0
"Most movies are lucky two have one memorable scene that sticks out and becomes the major moment of the movie. Endgame is blessed with being filled with them. A great ending to a story 11 years in the making, Endgame is only hindered by a few points that seem to hinder the overall pacing of the movie. Let's be honest, at this point we don't want to see exposition dumped, we want to see a bloodbath.",1
"Most of the 10s here are because of nostalgia as others have pointed out. The movie fails on many fronts, from forced cringe-worthy humor to bad story pacing. The third act of the movie is greatness, and is what redeems it.",0
most overrated film of 2019.This film is to boring why all the new super hero films has same scenario?,-1
Most thrilling 3 hours of my life. I thought avengers Infinity War was pretty dang good but Avengers Endgame is just so much better.,1
"movie had it's moments of ""awe"" and some very beautiful shots, but as a whole it was a huge disappointment, once the honeymoon phase is over in the next two weeks you'll see that with audience reviews and. scores.the good--Cap and Starks storyline came to a very nice conclusion--Cap being worthy of the hammer and assembling the avengers was the peak of the film--widow and hawkeyes moment before the soulstone was one of many tearjerkers of this movie--the visuals were amazing as alwaystoo much bad...--too long and not enough action, like over 2hrs of talking and just less than 45mins of actual action.--too much cringe from Cap Marvel every single scene she was in, way too OP, a healthy Thanos with all stones attacks her and she DOESN'T EVEN FLINCH AND JUST SMIRKS LIKE A MORON!! WTF is that??? lmao also she's so forced and such a last minute addition that there are too many plot holes with her. she's busy saving other worlds??? really?? Thanos is the biggest villain in the universe and has annihilated countless worlds within her jurisdiction, so where the **** was she? why hadn't she ""handled"" Thanos already???--they did Thor DIRTYYY, technically the most powerful of the earth heros, and goes through his character arc of Jerk hero full of himself, the downfall and finally his rise and belief in his ""godhood"" and completing his circle of the Thor that's close to his comic counterpart and king of Asgard....to being a basic ""fat clown"" in this movie, as if thats not bad enough he gives up his kindgom cause ""girl power"" so we can have a black female leading ""norse gods"" cause that makes sense.--Hulk isn't even hulk, he's just a nerd making jokes and never gets his chance at redemption and a cool fight with Thanos.--Black widow is killed off without her even getting her solo movie after having been in the movies the past decade...--the time travel arc was lame as hell and was not original whatsoever--Story was all over the place and convoluted ASF.honestly there's so much more to go on about but I'm sick of writing, will just post my reviews and forget about this movie ASAP. the rest of the MCU doesn't interest me aside from Guardians, especially if Thor is gonna be the new ""leader"" lol",-1
"Movie is e great conclusion to the VS Thanos Avengers saga,the story through the movie is both hearth-ripping and hearth-warming, the movie isn't perfect by any means of the word but it's a worth sequel to Infinity War and is on the bare top of the MarvelStudio's movies and sure is one of the best.",1
Movie was great. But difficult to understand for those who've not watched previous parts(MCU).,1
"Much better than Infinity War, it has a few surprises and some great moments. It brings a very satisfying finish to the decade of stories that begun with Iron Man. There was too little of Captain Marvel though.",1
My expectations of Marvel was higher toward the ending. There were some confusing moments that needed explanations after watching the movie which they did.Other than that the routine dosage of identity politics and feminism was annoying during the battle scenes.,0
My main complaint was there were just too many characters and even in a three hour movie...PLENTY of them wern't done justice...like Black Widow which I'm not really buying anyways..but still..it's almost like everyone forgot she was in the movie.That and the stupid undercutting humor at KEY partsIt was a celebration for the MCU...but also Back to the Future 2!Great scene at the end with Cap/Carter!7.5/10..but we're rounding up.,1
"Needed more Dr. Strange action! Felt like the final fight scene with Thanos could've been choreographed a lot better especially when you have a magic caster who could dish out different spells like Dr. Strange. But alas, he was instead given the duty of holding off the impending doom from crashing down on his team.",1
"Never felt like I could roll my eyes so much at such a comedic disaster. Yes the film uses nostalgia to wink at the audience every five minutes but this does nothing but make the film look like just another CGI overhaul fan film that gives its previous instalment (infinty war) little impact. The character deaths were predictable as was the plot, to be honest I had been waiting for iron mans death since five years ago, he's a cool character, but severely overhyped and overused at this point. As I mention the comedy is tragically bad, with every character suddenly pulling terrible jokes out of ""americas ass"" as Ant man puts it. I mean seriously, Thor the God of Thunder is now an overweight drunk playing fortnite?",-1
Never Gross Any Movie To Beat Avengers Endgame...Love You 3000  Times...,1
"Nice (but expected) time-travel stories added to the whole scenario. All of Marvel's women attacking the phallocratic pig, was just another overuse of today's feminist agenda and #metoo and reduced the epic scenes of the final battle.",-1
"Not a bad movie at all, but kind of a mess. The time travel aspect was done poorly imo and I didn't like the endings of some of the characters. This was a good ending though, I don't think Phase 4 onward is going to be anywhere near as good the previous phases.",0
Not a big fan of the ending. But I guess when you have only 0.000000000001% chance of winning you can't expect it to be the best ending there is.,0
"not as good as infinity war,slow fan service and the most sjw scene ever made",-1
"Not bad, good, but Infinity War far better. The Endgame is hm... Is too half-hearted and calculable.",1
"Not being a blind fanboy or been effected by hype, I can say that,The end game definitely lives up the hype but, only for last 30-45mins. The first half of the movie was filled up more with funny humour and unexpected condition of heroes after losing to Thanos in infinity war. Inshort, it falls flat in my opinion.I personally feel that Infinity war was better than end game due to ""powerful"" foundation of story and the fear of Thanos was very well projected.",1
"Not even close to being on Infinity War's level.  I went to a late show and nearly dozed off a dozen or so times.  I had to struggle to stay awake for the first 2 hours, literally.  It was that boring.  Also a ton of plot holes in this film.  Out of the 50% of everything that Thanos destroyed in the previous film, Ant-man is the only one to return in the beginning, because of some time travel quantum physics thing that is poorly explained, in which Iron Man discovers how to create time travel and isn't explained how, whatsoever.  He just magically creates it in his home with Pepper Pots.  Then there's the fact that Thor is a laughable and pathetic, depressed drunk who makes no contribution at all, and Banner Hulk is just awful.  Go into this film expecting a lot of boring nothingness for the first 90 minutes and you will find it maybe enjoyable.  Now the reason I give it a solid 7 after all this complaining, is that the final act of the movie is very engaging and enjoyable at least.  The action in the Avengers films is always great, and even though this final chapter had very little action until the end, it was good enough to make the film overall GOOD.  Just don't expect anything like the greatness that was Infinity War.",0
"Not every highly-anticipated movie lives up to the expectations but Avengers: Endgame is one of those few that delivered almost everything that's been promised or to some extent, even more. Not only this is the perfect follow up to INFINITY WAR (2018) but a remarkably done, moving homage to a 10 year long successful franchise consisting 21 films!While the first hour & so skillfully sets up the high-stakes, gradually reveals the remaining avengers in an utterly emotionally wounded & frustrated post Infinity War world, the film cleverly picks up the momentum right after that with lots of twists & turns backed up by little & big moments of excitements as well as tears of joy & heart-pounding loss at the end.Kudos to the director-duo Russo brothers, the writers and everyone involved with this absolute epic conclusion of the saga that ultimately pulled off the most satisfying ending this whole story arc could have offered.Can't figure at the moment how they or anyone will be able to top this one in coming years.",1
Not worth the money. biggest dissapointment in 2019.Good for Stan Lee that he must not see this ****,-1
"Nothing much to see here, just a return to the usual Marvel-movie quality level. It's good to see the non-superhero Iron Man finally removed from the picture, with his only power in being a rich guy and owner of advanced technology (and completely unconvincingly portrayed as being smart enough to build or fix said technology himself; kind of the equivalent of that other grossly overrated rich tech guy character we have IRL in a certain Elon Musk), though sadly they did have to turn him into The Great Martyr to get him over with.Really the only impressive Avengers movie in a long time was Infinity War, because it actually did something different and interesting, i.e. killing a lot of superheroes, and introduced a really good, complex villain. Beyond that, all they can do is return to their teen-boy oriented Marvel-as-usual movies.",-1
"Ok, I think I am done with movies. I feel like nothing can ever come close to this. Apart from a forced woke cringy scene where only all the female characters come together (wich will forever leave a mark on in what stupid times this movie was made) this movie and all the build up to it, is just epic and a pay off like many people would have wanted from game of thrones but never gotten.",1
One of marvel's best masterpieces. You will never be able to understand the movie without watching the entire series marvel series.,1
"One of the best movies I have ever watched ... ""Avengers : Endgame"" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !",1
"One of the best movies in its genre of the last 20 years. Your anticipation to go kick the bad guy's ass is skillfully levitated to an unforeseen height. Funny, thoughtful with only some time travelling inconsistencies that bothered me. Besides that, nearly perfect.",1
"One of the better marvel films. It was very emotional, and although the film lacks action, it is filled with great storytelling.",1
"One of the most artless movies I have ever experienced. Movie audiences are becoming more and more (numb, tolerant, enured) to mindless Hollywood spectacles like this, and unfortunately now so are the critics. If this is a standard for movie making, heaven help the movie industry. I can't help but compare it to Game of Thrones (last season not withstanding), and it fails miserably across all standards of comparison. I had absolutely no empathy for any of the characters, except maybe a bit for the bad guy (what was his name.. Thanos?) who seemed weary and forlorn. If you are 15 years old and liked this movie you can be excused for your taste. Otherwise, I think you are probably settling for some really lowbrow Hollywood bird-doodle.",-1
one of the most boring MCU movies to date. so many loop holes & unnecessary stale comedy that fell flat. the battle scene all 5 minutes of it in a freaking 3hr movie lmao pathetic!,-1
"One word: ok.First of all, I don't think I've ever seen such a cheap victory for the good guys. Without going into details, the best word I can think of is ""lame"". Thanos seemed like the one that fought the hardest and won because he was the strongest, until the Avengers cheated, and I'm not even talking about the time travel that they invented on the fly. People that saw the movie know what I'm talking about.What the **** was Gamora's motivation? The amount of **** the movie needs to pull so that the Avengers can win is fanfiction worthy.Then there is this grl powah the movies are trying to pull. Here is how you know you're being sexist: invert the genders and if you cringe, you are being sexist. What the hell did they do to Thor? How would that have looked like if they pulled that with Carol?. Why is it funny funny that Gamora did that to Peter? He didn't know it was another Gamora. For ****s sake. It's childish and unnecessary.The good thing is that for every stupid crap the movies pulls, it has something great or heartwarming too. What a great goodbye this movie was. Just not on the same level as Infinity War. But a good watch.",-1
"Oujeah this is it. The best Avengers movie, you are in for a treat. Mindblowing blot twist at the end so i don't wanna spoil it for you.",-1
Overall a bad movie. Movie is too slow and lacks action. The grand finale comes down to random heroes making a big entrance and holding the gauntlet for a few sec. Just a shell of Infinity Wars. Pity.,-1
"Overall great movie hampered by a very slow start (3 hours really not necessary here), a lack of consistency (fans of thor wont be too happy), comedy that falls short and what feels forced into the overall quite serious story and some fairly distracting politics pushing. Captain Marvel was an unwanted intruder into the story of familiar characters and quite often I sighed out loud at the blatant attempts to garner the attention of the media or get awards. Entertainment should be entertainment and whether I agree or disagree with the politics, I would rather they refrain from using a fun action superhero movie as a political platform.The ending alone however is a fitting conclusion to the marvel story and unforgettable though to actually enjoy the film properly you will have needed to have kept up with the majority of the MCU which is one hell of a task and will probably leave you a bit tired of the superhero genre. To improve on this movie they would need to have fixed the pacing at the start of the movie, yes its building up to the conclusion but so has every marvel movie, you don't need 2 hours to explain things.They would get rid of the politics pushing. Captain Marvel should not have suddenly popped up to brag about how strong she was, felt empty and insulting to the original heroes. Also forcing all the female characters to be in one scene for a snapshot for the media might sound like a good idea but one doesnt actually fight and one was meant to be fixing something so it felt distractingly pushed.They also should not have messed with Thor as much as they did and they should not have messed around with the 'strength' of all the heroes. This universe is too old to suddenly add a hero a few weeks before the conclusion of it all who dwarfs the rest of them in strength (Captain marvel)...",0
"Overall too mediocre plot and too overhyped movie. 2.5 hours of reflexion and flashbacks, 10 minutes of action and 20 minutes of condolesences. Tanos shifts motives like he has a PMS. Thor is depicted a clown. Captain Marvel is added just to approve feminists' trends. Too dissapointing even for the marvel fanboys.",-1
"Overall, I enjoyed this follow-up to Infinity War, if not as much as its predecessor. First off, there is a lot of fanservice, and I mean a lot! Some of it is effective, including subtle references that pay tribute to past MCU films in creative ways that make you proud to have seen all the previous films. However, it also includes painfully corny scenes that are guaranteed to make you roll your eyes. The first thirty minutes or so are good, if a bit rushed and underplayed at certain times. Ultimately it is a solid start that grabs your attention and doesn’t let go. This first part is mostly to tie off any loose ends from Ininifty War, before we undergo a time jump, in order to show the calamity that the Thanos snap caused. This is an emotional, realistic and well-done start. From there, we get introduced to the main plot of the film, which involves reversing the effects of Infinity War. This is introduced a bit too quickly and conveniently in my opinion. From there, we spend a little time getting the band back together and seeing how other Avengers have been affected by the events of Infinity War. Several have changed, and quite frankly, they’ve done so for the better. Thor and Hulk are two standouts, as they’ve become more original, unique characters through the aftermath of Infinity War and what this film decided to do with them. This period begins the more lighthearted tone this film will have compared to Infinity War. I’m a bit lukewarm about the tone, considering how much I loved the dark tone of Infinity War, but it does suit the movie and it’s story. The humor is arguably one of the best parts of the movie. The jokes almost always land perfectly and the film has an excellent, natural sense of humor about it. The time travel is an iffy subject, as many movies fail to get it right, but this movie works with it well, despite getting a bit convoluted in its explanations. The execution of the time travel itself is nice and straightforward, designed to entertain as opposed to constantly trying to explain itself. This is the point in which the movie begins paying homage to past MCU films in fun and clever ways. These are also the moments in which the character interactions are the strongest. We get a variety of different tones throughout this middle act, from pure drama, to action, to even comed, and surprisingly enough, it all flows smoothly and in a watchable manner. This leads directly into the third act. The transition between the middle and the end is a bit rough, especially considering how different the two are. The third act ... is a tough one. It is essentially one giant final battle followed by a denouement. The battle is, well, it’s a lot. It’s hard not to feel like it’s overstuffed and the battle is just visually hard to follow. It’s certainly a more straightforward superhero action fight than I’m used to compared to the first two thirds of the film and Infinity War. The resolution of the battle however, is so immensely satisfying and clever, it’s hard not to feel like the whole thing is worth it. And, cue the waterworks. It wasn’t unexpected, but the finale of the film brings a huge toll for the MCU. No matter your expectations, the Russo Brothers know how to handle emotion, as clearly evident by almost everything in Infinity War, and this movie nails it, as far as emotion is concerned. The movie ends in a sort of bittersweet fashion, but one that’s incredibly well-directed, and hard to resist. Even the credits pay tribute to the 10+ years of the MCU in incredible fashion. All in all, even if at times, it struggles to sustain itself under its gigantic proportions, or fit itself into even the longest of superhero runtimes, Avengers Endgame is an emotionally impactful, satisfying thrill ride that knows what it needs to do and does it: entertain.",0
Overrated and overlong. It needs to be trimmed to 2 hours and it would be much better. Action is good even if there's not enough,-1
"Poor and boring fight moments, stupid jokes for idiots and e hours of next thing. Fat Thor, Captain with god’s hummer and others silly moment destroyed this movie",-1
"poor fanservice, politically correct and class B comedy: repeat.Things that shouldn't be in a sequel of a movie with the darkest finale ever.It's slow, full of stupid gags, characters like thor and hulk completely wasted and ruined.Everything go as you expect:the plan: go back in time, get the stones, bring everyone backWhat happen: go back in time, get the stones, bring everyone back...OOPS past Thanos discover by LUCK everything, with the other one dead was OBVIOUS the past one would have entered.Past Thanos stronger than the one with GODLY POWERS, Black Widow die and everyone don't even care, the scene with the girls...horrible movie after infinity war",-1
Por Dios que 3 horas más largas. Total para contar algo que ya se ha contado demasiadas veces,-1
"Possibly one of the most overrated movies of all time and in my eyes the weakest of the marvel movies produced. All credit from this movie comes from the stunning visual effects and the well crafted score composed by Alan Silvestri, however when the budget is over 350 million dollars, it’s hard for the vfx to look bad. The pacing and tone of the movie was all over the place, and seemed split between going for a lighthearted feel like Guardians Of The Galaxy, or a more serious outlook like Infinty War. The movie was fun yes, but for a decade of build up and being a sequel to the arguably the best mcu movie of all time, Infinity War, the movie fell short in meeting the expections of what I had in mind. They turned my 2 favourite hero's of Hulk and Thor into characters only there for comedic value. A decade of character development just for them to lose all of that in Endgame really ruined the movie in my opinion. The movie suffered from an extreme imbalance between comedy and seriousness, and for that reason I believe it to be the most underwhelming marvel movie of all time.",-1
"Predictable and boring. Just another superhero movie, nothing like Infinity War which felt like a great action movie, with brilliant plot twists. Bad jokes and three hours of Marvel trying to make every superhero look good and have a good ending.",-1
Pretty **** good I mean sure Black Widow died and Stark(LOVE3000)but like yknow worst case scenario they milk this franchise,1
Pretty boring compared to infinity war. Missing some of the best characters and overall unsatisfying,-1
"Probably the largest scale film of our generation, with plenty of action and heart felt moments. Unfortunately, some of the plot holes are too big to forgive and forget and, at times, didn't even feel like an Avengers film.",1
Probably worst movie of MCU. There is nothing making sense about time travel. Dr. Strange only can hold glass of water in this movie. Iron man died for nothing if he just give it those stones to Cap. Marvel hole equation would've solved. But still last battle was awesome and again Thor is a totally disappointing. And what was the Thanos? How can even he be so powerful?,0
"PROS: stunning visuals and animations; good music; compelling interactions between the main characters that have stayed since The Avengers (2012); satisfying resolution to the 11 year long ""Infinity Saga"" story arc.CONS: it takes itself too seriously for a fantasy story with super-powered characters dressed in costumes; overlong and overcrowded 3-hour space-time action-adventure that lacks creativity; excessive use of CGI in detriment of real acting.",-1
"Quite good, great effects (as expected). It was interesting to see Avengers beaten, broken, a nice phoenix arc.Only downsides are Captain Marvel (damn, that actress is wooden) and one cringy feminist scene, thankfully a very short one.Since many of the best are out/dead (or promised to NOT have a series/movie like Scarlet Witch), I don't think following products will be worth watching. If you are really invested, I would recommend waiting for proper reviews for a few weeks (just ignore ""professional"" critics), or buy it at significant discount.",1
RDJ's best ever performance and a fitting end to a franchise. Even brie larson's utter awfulness as an actor and character wasn't enough to detract from it. truly a masterpiece to thank Russo's for. must watch.,1
Really boring and disappointing movie.  Quite predictable.  Hulk and Thor are made ridiculous.  The worst movie of the MCU.,-1
"Realmente no estamos ante evento cinematográfico del siglo. Es una película entretenida llena de conveniencias y algunos huecos de guion. No es insoportable pero tampoco es, como ya se dijo, lo mejor del Aquí algunas inconsistencias:- Capitán A. y el martillo de Thor es un gran Deus Ex Machina- La rata que libera a Ant Man es la mayor conveniencia de la película.- El hecho de que Thanos pudiera viajar al ""futuro"" es imposible, pues solo se había entregado dos frascos de partículas Pin a cada personaje, por ende entre Nebula y War Machine solo tenían 4, 2 fueron gastadas cuando ambos viajaron al ""pasado"" y la última cuando War Machine vuelve al ""presente"", por ende la última solo pudo ser usado por Nebula o Thanos, aunque finalmente todo su maldito ejército va al ""presente""-El hecho de que hayan tirado el guante con las gemas me hace pensar en una película slasher cuando los personajes tiran un arma a pesar de que están en peligro, en el caso de Avengers a pesar de que tienen el arma más peligrosa  -A su vez si hubieran usado el guente en la batalla con Thanos la película no se hubiera    alargado más, aunque esa batalla si estuvo buena.-Capitana Marvel al comienzo y al final llegando porque sí.- Al final Iron Man le quita las gemas a Thanos ¿cómo?, no importa mientras que los buenos ganen.- Aunque no afecte a la trama el Cap. viejo del final no tendría sentido si se sigue la lógica de la película, si aquello que sucede en un ""pasado"" realmente no afecta al futuro.",-1

"Sadly, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I did with the first ""Avengers"" movies.",0
"Scarlet Witch's rage was terrifying! She proved to everyone not to mess with her, with her man, or else, there'll be hell to pay.",1
"See it, there is nothing I can say that will explain just how incredibly amazing this film is but I shall try, and I know myself now I won’t be able to convey just how brilliant Avengers: End Game truly is and for that reason see it. I’m someone who has never been to see a film twice at a cinema and I’m already trying to find excuses for another viewing, I rarely enjoy watching the same film twice in a year and with this I’m considering twice in the same week it is just that good and I cannot recommend it enough. See it, I do not know how you could not enjoy this film. I also want to mention, I saw nothing of this film, no trailers, no early reviews literally nothing and it made it that much better, now I don’t know if that would affect the experience but there may have been parts I was loving but people already knew of because it was in a trailer. In addition to that, I had not planned to see this movie in the cinema at all, because I hadn’t been as excited for superhero films as of late, silly me to assume a Marvel movie is just a simple superhero movie. But a friend of mine asked when am I going and when I said don’t think I will he responded with so much shock and told me that I have to see it, I booked my tickets there and then, two days before he gets to see it while at the same time being one of the people who saw it opening night. So, you can see my expectations were so low and yet I feel like I can say that was perhaps one of if not the single greatest piece of media that I’ve ever consumed in my life. Being someone who grew up with Marvel movies starting as a child and now being considered a adult to watch this celebration of this cinematic universe truly was magic. It was a love letter to itself in the best possible way, it would have small hints towards previous films that made you proud to be a fan, the last word in the big climactic battle is the best call back I’ve ever heard, and simply writing about it makes me smile and giggle because it’s so clever and brilliant and perfect and I want to see it again and again. Going into this film and seeing that three hour run time pretty much put me off this film I just couldn’t imagine a scenario where a film could keep me enthralled for such an extended period of time, yet it truly used each minute perfectly, nothing felt as if it dragged on or was unnecessary, and that’s itself confuses me how is that possible. Three hours and I’m stick stuck in my seat begging for another ten, twenty, hell I’d take another hour of it was that good. There were two moments that damn near broke me, and while I won’t go into it, when you see these two scenes you just feel this intense sense of dread and sorrow and it blows me away that I’ve connected with so many of these people who are so far from standard people, and it just shows how real this universe feels, you don’t doubt any of it, you just sit there saying “Of course , of course this is happening”. But they have those moments alongside some truly great comedy, and I’m just think how this one film can get so much feeling out of me. There’s a moment in the final smaller scale fight scene where I’m sat there giddy saying it’s going to happen they’re actually going to do it and then you’re filled with so much pride for paying attention to the smallest details in other films that become huge moments in this epic. The music is also phenomenal, it always adds to the tone and it just punctuates what’s going on so incredibly well and it’s another thing that’s leaving me somewhat speechless because how can I convey how amazing this is without someone understanding exactly what I mean. This film is truly the perfect superhero film, the perfect sequel, and without a doubt one of the greatest films of all time. One last time, go and see this film, go and watch this phenomenal piece in cinema before you hear everyone talking about every detail ruining what would be the perfect way to see this film, because when you know nothing about it, everything and I mean everything feels perfect.",1
"slightly disappointing end to the avengers saga. It only kept you on the edge but never got you to jump. personally i felt it lacked action scenes for example, hulk never got to fight thanos and captain marvel came towards the end only. yes i understand there was going to be certain number of dialogue to be made to complete the story but still, as an ending and a 3 hour movie i felt the content should have been more. the movie focused too much on the feels and not so much on the works. in the end its a decent ending but still felt it could have been pushed more.7.5-8/10",0
"so epic,amazing,I love movie three thousands.I have been a fan of Marvel for 9 years and it's so sad when this is last I've seen iron man,Captain america and... Black widow.in my opinion, I vote 10/10 for this one",1
"So here is where all the threatened males are coming to rate the movie a zero because “women” have a moment in the movie, but they can’t quite give the movie a zero because it’s also the best super hero movie they have seen in their entire lives. So we get a lot of 5’s because the conflicted “fandom” of sensitive males can’t put aside their injured egos and rate this film honestly.Review: The movie doesn’t have the wall to wall action of Infinity War, but when the action comes, the impact is far more spectacular. The writing is spot on, the performances, the emotion... amazing. The only place I could dock this movie a point is trying to decide when to go pee because movie soft drinks and 3 hour runtimes are not a good mix for me.Do not see this movie unless you have seen at least the last episode of each the individual movies. The impact will be so much greater. But to everyone else... SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. This is the the movie event of this decade.",1
"So I went into this not expecting much, and really not knowing much about the universe. (Only watched the first two...got dragged into this by my boyfriend)There’s several issues with these movies that explain my score;- they spend far too time coming up with an hour worth of cheesy jokes that the movies feel to drag on and on.- Several of the action scenes scream B-movie cheese (Japanese scene (unneeded), several fight scenes toward the end)- They made captain America at the end seem like he went from 100% saving the world/perhaps resurrecting Iron Man to “nope screw people I’m retiring”- A lot of bad acting as usual in these kind of movies- they make alcoholism seem like it’s okay and something to joke aboutCouple pros:- some of the more well done action scenes were fantastic, visually pleasing- Robert Downey Jr and Peter Parker (forgot the actors name) at the end had a fantastic performance",-1
"So... here’s my opinion about Marvels Endgame, and some of you might find it VERY unpopular to say this....I stopped watching marvel movies because of Endgame.I’ve had enough of the MCU. I stopped watching after Ironman and black widow died, Thor retired to go play fortnite (that is not a joke, that is real), and Captain America, the only level headed Avenger left, went back to the past to live out his life with the woman he loves... AND NOT TELL ANYONE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS! Seriously, why didn’t he say anything to Shield all that time, this whole time we’re suppose to believe that their were 2, and at some point 3, Captain America’s that all existed at the same point in time, and he knew what was going to happen years before it actually happened. He could’ve prevented much of the death and disasters that occurred as a result of the events in previous movies, but also better prepared the Avengers by telling them about Thanos years before he got the stones. You would think he would do something like this, but you’d be wrong...There is so much history with these characters... whereas with Falcon, Valkyrie, and... Captain Marvel, they feel kind of like they're known as the side kicks of these superheroes, and therefore don’t hold as much weight as the big 3 imo. Which is a big deal to me because they’re being set up to be the new big 3 in the coming next generation and... Marvel has given me zero reason to care for these characters. I don’t expect them to ever carry as much weight as the OG’s, but they could’ve at least devoted a little more time and character development on these characters and making them as likable as possible.So are they just going to ignore the events of Civil War? Because they did not even mention it at all throughout endgame. It would’ve been at least nice if Tony Stark and kept in America acknowledge that the Civil War happened. Nope, Tony Stark just gives captain his shield back and they just move on with their lives. About Black Widows death:Her death was the same as Gamora’s death. She cracked her skull on pavement a died instantly. And her body was never recovered so they can’t give her a proper burial. I hardly call that a fitting end to a beloved character. You ever wonder why the Russo’s put Hawkeye and Black Widow together? What if they didn’t have a close friendship? Then what? Then they couldn’t get the crystal. And that’s what bothers me about that part, it felt forced in a way. After all the plot devices that held us in disbelief, that brought characters back, why does this have to be the exception? It just feels like bad writing to me.Gamora dying is going to be such a strange thing the Guardians will HAVE to bring up in their new movies, because the Russo's have essentially reset Gamora's character, and if they don't acknowledge that, then what a huge waste of a life that is.I can’t.... it gets me infuriated just talking about it. I am so jaded and numb about the way the original avengers departed, I just don't care about the MCU anymore... And it sucks. I was sorely disappointed by Endgame and it soured my appreciation for ALL of the other MCU movies that preceded it... What a horrible way to end.This movie is a mixed bag, it's got great visuals and some nice eye candy from VFX. It's not really enjoyable to anyone who hasn't watched the other marvel movies. And the story decisions are pretty baffling.",-1
Solid finish to the MCU. Glad there won't be any more movies in the franchise.Could have been a solid 10 if they cut 15 minutes of 'woke' footage.,1
"Solid Marvel pic but too long.  The movie is definitely fun and a “must see” if you’re even a mild Marvel fan.  Yet, be warned there’s nothing new here and with all the hype I expected more.  The first two thirds of the movie are really slow and the plot feels labored and stale.  The last third of the movie is more interesting - yet, even there, the fights seem totally redundant.  Although I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it, I feel like this movie reinforces the idea that Marvel needs a fresh approach going forward.  Also, I have to comment on the length of the movie, three hours with no intermission just doesn’t work.  At least a third of the viewers in our theater had to get up and take a break during the screening... viewers of all ages by the way... so, I’d like to see either a shorter cut of the movie or an intermission built in...  its very distracting when people are moving in/out of the theater.",-1
Some of the scenes were unnecessary and could've been just cut out entirely and the movie would still make sense. I expected more from this 3-hour film but it turned out to be just a complete waste of time.,0
"Some questionable character choices, a lack of stakes, and some uneven pacing are dramatically overshadowed by the payoffs and fan service that rewards you for being on the journey rather than feeling pretentious.",1
"Speaking of Gomorrah, seeing her again was great, but they wasted it. TBH, Nebula was great and the stark contrast in the progression of her character, from her interactions with Tony at the very beginning to her and Gomorrah on Thanos’s ship, was really compelling. However, Gomorrah really disappointed me. She has so much depth and tension in her character and they explored it really well in Infinity War, when Quill tried to kill her, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in this one, she changed her mind about her father REAL quick and OFF SCREEN and was really a throwaway character despite the fact that her death was one of the true deaths of infinity war and one of the most beautifully tragic moments for Thanos and humanized him. If they aren’t going to bring her back and give her a real touching moment, then just give her an Easter egg like with Loki and Thor, which was a great moment and really hit the nostalgia. Which brings me to the biggest plot confusion of the movie, which I was thinking about the entire time - isn’t it really hard for a human to hold an infinity stone? They made a huge **** deal about it in Guardians of the Galaxy, and they talked mad **** about how powerful they were, and yet all 13 of the **** were tossing them around like nothing?Furthermore, giving the Hulk the first snap is a **** disgrace, but I’m biased because I hate the Hulk. Bruce and the Hulk combined, great for him, is an obvious culmination of the entire Hulk storyline as a final resolution to his constant warring over the two halves of him, but he’s not a compelling character, he has no depth and he’s pretty **** useless in battle, but he got the snap and survived because he’s super strong!!!! At that point in the movie I was thinking that the director’s were just like “let’s just give them all something so we can end this **** series and move the **** on”. On an aesthetic note, one thing that I thought was so great about Thor Ragnorak and Infinity War were the great, artistic, and cinematic moments when some big, movie changing **** was happening (Thor’s lightning scene jesus **** But Hulk’s snap was in that white ass, clinically lit room in such a tight shot, and you only know it worked because of **** Hawkeye, whose wife is calling him, who once again I will say I don’t give a singular **** about. It just seemed such a far cry from Thanos’s snap moment, and Iron Man’s final snap which were given the time and artistry that they deserved, considering they were LITERALLY movie changing scenes. Speaking of important, climactic scenes scenes, I feel like Captain Marvel wasn’t wonderfully incorporated. She seems to be a very divisive character, from people hating her standalone movie to the rumors that the cast hated Brie Larson, but honestly, if she could knock Thanos out and give him a fair fight, where was she this whole time? She is literally supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe, and she was on the sidelines for the majority of this movie. I will admit there were great scenes, like any Tony/Peter interaction and Cap finally getting his dance with Peggy. These are things that the fans of the MCU have probably been asking for since forever, and getting these moments was quite satisfying. However, Cap being able to wield Thor’s hammer, which happens in the comics and is quite a popular demand of the Russo brothers, was not well explained. Especially with all the **** that Thor went through, giving up this moment for him was a little bit devastating for a Thor fan, and ultimately made me feel like this movie did him SO **** DIRTY. Obviously that moment has its fans and it was pretty well done cinematically, but if Cap is holding Mjolnir, he has the power of Thor, making Thor pretty extraneous in this movie. Also, when was he deemed worthy (tbh I don’t love Cap and knowing all the **** Thor went through to get Mjolnir back when he wasn’t worthy it feels a little bit quick/rushed/convenient/lazy). I think that they could have left many things out (them listing time travel movies, as funny as that is, was at least 5 minutes of my life I could have gotten back) in favor of spending more time developing our last moments with these original Avengers that have shaped our modern conception of superheroes. I went in with incredibly high expectations, and this movie fell quite short of them, but honestly, it gave a lot of lip service to what the fans wanted, to a point where the movie just felt like funny clips strung together by a flimsy plot line. And it was a funny movie - to a point where every serious or dark or tragic movie was almost immediately undercut with levity. Ultimately I think this movie had to do too much and didn’t have the time or bandwidth to do it all perfectly, and I’ll miss all the original Avengers despite the failings of this movie. [2/2]",-1
Spidey and Mr. Stark 's reunion tugged my heartstrings. The relief on Tony's face said it all.,0
Strong final stansa in a long running and entertaining franchise. A 3 hour epic that motors along at a good pace,1
Such a perfect culmination of the entire MCU. It is everything any fan could have ever wished for and so much more.,1
Such an epic ending for an eleven-year franchise of Marvel Cinematic Universe.,1
"Summary: Avengers Endgame is like starting to enjoy the best sex of your life, and just when you get to that special moment.....your kids walk into your bedroom. Negatives: There are some girl power scenes that are just too conspicuous. I would have rather had the messages conveyed to me in a more subtle way and not rammed down my throat. Speaking of conspicuous, Bree Larson is out of place in Endgame. Her scenes with the other cast members in some way seem as if they were not a part of the original plan for the movie. The chemistry was just not there. I don't have a problem with Bree or her causes, she can express her opinion on whatever she likes. I just don't think she is ready to take the mantle as Marvels next big attraction. The next problem I had with Endgame is some of the character arcs the directors decided to use for Thor and Hulk. There is definitely some room for improvement. Now for the positives! The movie, for the most part, is a fantastical journey of over 11 years culminated into one giant thank you to the fans of the comic, and moviegoers alike. I loved the action, the heartache, and the triumphal moments that Endgame provided over the 3 hours of film time. You find yourself cheering, crying, and on the edge of your seat at times wanting to see your favorite Avenger give his or her due to Thanos. Thor and Rocket are hilarious! This movie is not a waste of time and you will be thoroughly entertained.",0
"Super quickly, this is my review.Act 1: Weird pacing, weird character intros (thor, hawkeye), Act 2: amazing fan service, great character bonding moments.Act 3: the greatest act of any marvel film!! The fight scene, the music, the VFX,, the ending, everything is perfect!Entire Movie: This movie is phenomenal is several ways and makes the last 11 years more memorable than they already are!",1
"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Its more then just EPIC, I have nothing more to say,just 3000 love it!!!",1
"Sure the final fight with Thanos is more than epic, but I expected more than that. I wanted substance and a plot that didn't rely on ""quantum"" for all the questions and explanations.",0
"Sure you could argue that this movie is overrated. But I just can't deny that this is a really solid finale for the MCU franchise. Great sendoff to Tony, Steve, and Natasha. The MCU will never be as good ever again after this and Infinity War.",1
"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman,  fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.The movie itself  was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from  all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with  achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",0
Thank God it's finally over. Infinity Wars was a rarity in the superhero world in having a real flesh and blood antagonist with depth. But they turned Thanos into cardboard in Endgame. Big budget junk food in visual form. Totally forgettable.I'll give points for technical proficiency but for the 3 hours of smaltz and saccharin mawkishness I'll give nothing.,-1
"Thank you, Russo Brothers. Thank you for taking charge and ending the amazing saga on such a brilliant note. Like all Marvel films, I'll watch this one over and over again.",1
"Thanks, Russo!It's just a great movie and the ending itself!Pity of course(And sometimes sad.(",1
"Thanos finished the world, understandable, but why that long face? Everyone knew from the start that world was going to come back (and with new hair styles) so why spend first 60 minutes being so serious?They followed the formula all 2-part movies do (Kill Bill Vol-1/2, Harry Potter and Deathly Hollow 1/ 2) where first part is all about action and next one a lot drama with action in the end. Lesser known avengers could sue Thanos for discrimination as he left most famous Avengers to undo what he had done. But in the same way, Thanos can sue Disney and Marvel for strategically delaying Captain Marvel Movie Hence Captain Marvel was kind of immune to the disintegration phenomenon. Not only that but every single Avenger was saved with no serious injury in a massive missile attack by Thanos just before the final better. So was Antman who was in Quantam Realm, strangely 5 years were only 5 hours to him, but not to the Wasp who stayed there for some 30 years but aged 300 years which should have been 30 hours only.Logic behind saving the world was so grossly cliché and confusing that most of the time it was hard to catch up. Introduction of time machine and promise to not engage with past selves or play with the thread of time was so lame. Eventually they had to come up with the most stupid reasons to fill up the black holes they created in their stories. Like previous movie, End game has infinite stares. In an action packed movie where every response is predicted, a serious focus on a character and his dense stare feels awkward. Infused drama about every character, we know how much everyone thrives for science yet they refuse in the start to only come up with the solution in snap of a finger. Be it Bruce Banner or Tony Stark. Greatest science inventions like time machine are shown to be as easy as boiling eggs. Time travel not only revives dead and disintegrated characters but makes avengers even more strong. I wondered if they thought to go back in time and fix 9/11.Since writers were extremely lazy while developing the idea for the movie and could not weave in all the events in the past with their retrospective effects, they brought in an alternate reality approach so that they could mess up other realities to save the one they are in. And avengers in other realities are so lazy and sacrificing that they didn’t lift a finger to save their realities because Disney was not making movie about their reality.Character profile and development is perhaps strongest if we minus the excessive drama. Tony and Captain get the strongest storyline. Natasha’s departure and response by rest of avengers was perhaps forced into the story. All these years and no one knew if she had a family? What kind of friendship they have? Finally, the most commercial idea of passing Captain America’s shield (franchise torch) to someone colored. There was a Wonder Woman moment when all females assembled to secure Captain Marvel’s trip to time machine. Special effects are nothing new and same goes for the weird creatures.End Game might try to invoke that feeling which you have when a very long series end but it infuses more drama and action it actually needed and the ending in every possible way was predictable and weak.",-1
"Thanos is the greatest hero ever if he snapped first trimesters not 4th. Captain Marvel is the worst villain trying to stop him on other worlds. The could have been over in seconds if Iron man ran up and held his hand. Half as long and the movie would be the same. The Superheros powers were did strengths in every scene. How Thor go down after a punch and kick, yet Captain American took several punches w/o being totally crushed!   AI bot written 10 Star reviews and the critics are bought off. Mortal Engines was better.",-1
That final fight with Thanos was epic! Great idea by the writers to have everybody be teleported back when Cap needed them the most. Officially the greatest superhero movie of all time!,1
"That's such an amazing movie, with a deserved outcome! Came to fruition as a film that came to leave the legacy of the original Avengers - who have sacrificed themselves for the common good, in their own way. Gave me goosebumps to the beggining till the end. I love Marvel Studios and love so much this cast and these heroes for life!",1
The action scenes were good and had enough twists in the plot to keep it from becoming predictable.,1
"The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren’t enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers. I did know that there was gonna be some time travel involved, but the way Marvel explained and executed it didn't too well for me. They can't get away with just putting it all in ""Quantum.”",-1
"The avengers waste 2 hours doing nothing the movie is nothing like the comics, feels like a YouTube parody.",-1
"The Avengers: The End of the Game left mixed impressions. At one time, a very good outcome of the plot, and at another time ... An incredibly dark film, very few deaths, Thanos is absolutely not the one we saw him! Pros: Incredible outcome of the plot, special effects are incredible! The brothers Rousseau did not pass over! Cons: The film is incredibly dull and dark. Even in time travel everything was dim. My score is 8/10. In general, the film left a good impression. I advise to view!",1
"The beginning dragged along but the end was really good especially the final battle against Thanos. Very emotional. I haven't seen too many Marvel movies, but this is the best I've seen so far. I can only see Marvel improving from here.",1
"The best avengers movie ever created, you must watch it! Really best movie in 2019!",1
"the best ending for a long term phaze.there are some loop holes though , but i was so satisfied.",1
"The best experience I've ever had at the cinema! I cried a lot, laughed and got very excited at different times. The best movie of 2019.",1
"The best film in the MCU (so far). The events of Infinity War brought us to this movie, and after so much excitement, intrigue, and waiting, we have it. It didn’t disappoint. The story (without spoiling it), is full of twists, unexpected stories, and an exciting cast of characters who can lead the MCU to a new level of greatness. This movie is long, yet still left us wanting it to continue. The special effects shined, the acting stayed amazing, and the movie was presented in a Fashion only Marvel can provide.",1
"The best marvel movie to date that is no question, don't want to write any spoilers but it has a satisfying ending, wraps up perfectly that last 10 yrs. There is some aspect of the movie that not everybody will like, but just think about how hard to fit 20 characters in one movie and write them into the story, except 1 character they pulled it off brilliantly. Hard to write it without any spoilers, but for any comic-books fan it a must. For everyone else, don't think about it too hard, just enjoy the ride.",1
The best movie on MCU. This movie is masterpiece. That's enough. This film best best best...,1
The best movie to ends mcuIm sure you are going to love this filmThanks marvel♥️,1
The Best super-heroic movie EVER! The MOST Sentimental movie MCU has ever revealed. It's about 3 hours but you just get lost in the movie and suddenly find out the movie has finished. It makes you laugh and then brings your tears out and leaves you confused and stunned. EXCELLENT!!!,1
"The best way to describe Endgame is chaotic which is expected when a movie tries to bring together so many characters. However, many sub-plot lines seem shoehorned. Captain Americas demise seemed strange, and really didn't fit the movie. How Iron Man managed to take the stones off of the glove at the end didn't make sense. Captain America coming in and destroying the entire enemy ship as if it were butter, I mean come on, had she shown up 10 minutes sooner there would not have been any fight. That should be a sign of a character that is too OP. Thanos is initially able to throw Captain Marvel aside, then tries again and isn't able to without the power stone. The evil nebula dying without killing a single character. Thanos refusing to finish off any of iron man, thor, or captain america even though he indicated that it was personal now. He literally just stood there for a minute doing nothing until the reinforcements showed up. Thor, captain america, and iron man were unable to defeat thanos without him even having the stones? It seemed like the 3 of them together would've been able to pull it off in infinity war if thanos hadn't had the stones yet. These are just the plot holes I can remember 3 days after watching.The pacing of the movie was herky jerky as well. I was yawning in the theater for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Some parts were just too slow and drawn out. Finally, if you're going to kill off captain america and iron man, they should have killed thor as well to wrap it all up cleanly. Not only that, but let the legacy of the characters end there. Don't pass the captain america shield to his side kick and the role of iron man to tony starks wife and friend.The sound and music was great. The video effects were awesome. I didn't have a problem with most of the jokes or spoken lines. But the plot holes, pacing, and legacies are what subtracted 4 points for me.",-1
"The biggest mess in cinema history, so devoid of logic and credibility you wish Thanos would win. Everyone is a joke.",-1
"The biggest problem with Endgame is that it is far too long. Right from the start it has ponderously long scenes. The same story could have been presented in 2 hours without losing a word. Other problems include never learning why Dr. Strange did what he did at the end of Infinity War, a funny but unexplained change to the Hulk, and a major plot device we have already seen in an X-Men movie, a plot device that renders all drama going forward meaningless. Nothing that happens in the next Spider-Man movie, nothing that happens in the upcoming Black Widow movie, matters ... at all. All problems are now, according to what Endgame established, completely fixable after the fact. Finally, Captain Marvel is MUCH too powerful. In one scene (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers) she destroys something very very very large simply by flying through it. If she can do that, none of the other Avengers are really even relevant. Also, I recall that no one but Thor could lift Thor's hammer, so why is Captain America running around with it like it weighs 10 pounds?The good stuff: great scenes with Tony Stark; great scenes with Steve Rogers. In fact, without the personal touches regarding Tony and Steve I would have given this movie a 5. There were a handful of jokes that made the audience roar with laughter but I was in the last row and the jokes were spoken so softly by the characters I couldn't hear what was being said. But I will assume they were great and so list them under the positives.And that's about it. Not spectacular. Though I do give the writers credit for weaving so many characters into the mix (though not enough Black Widow fight scenes for my taste).",-1
"The biggest takeaway from ‘Avengers: End Game’ is just how much of an emotional roller coaster it is.  There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie—our personal favorite was the line “pick a side, Lebowski”—which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness.Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained.  The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust.  Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could’ve reasonably guessed.  And as of this moment there’s a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of ‘Avengers: End Game.’  Google “Thanos” then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen.  Enjoy.Rating: 8.5/10",1
"The bow the tried to wrap everything up with at the end of the movie was a little wrinkled, but the movie experience was one I will never forget.Also: Sam says ""On your left""",1
The combination of 21 films does not disappoint. It’s not your typical Marvel movie as the Russo’s make this one different yet great like all there MCU films. This is an absolute blast of a film with so many emotional moments I’d be shocked if you didn’t cry. It has so many callbacks to past movies you wouldn’t be wasting your time rewatching every MCU film. Just wow. This film is amazing.,1
"The continuation of the war of infinity. the film is very cool! The unexpected death of Thanos at the beginning, 5 years later, fat Thor, Bruce and Hulk in one body, traveling during the time, clicking the Hulk, this is something with something. Sorry for Tony Stark and Cap (Seeing him an old man is insulting). We lost two superheroes, but Thanos got his own.",1
"The emotional impact still derives from Zemeckis' expedients on the silliness of the second chance through a time travel. I hoped that, after the failure even of Brian Greene with ""Déjà Vu"" (Tony Scott, 2006), someone would have had the common sense as well as the humility for the recovery of the teachings provided by the philosophy and theology of the time: the only logical way to really change the status quo is, if anything, the reversal of the chronological flow. But geniuses like Klimov (""Come and See"", 1985) are more unique than rare.(Mauro Lanari)",-1
The end of everything and the transition to a new phase. I really liked it and I'm glad that Brie Larson had so little screen time.,1
The ending of Avengers. Let's just go to the past and change everything that happened before.,0
The fight scene in the end was so good it definitely redeemed the past scenes that were a bit slow paced but the overall story is something that will remain remembered forever,1
"The film may not have outstanding action scenes as the previous ones but it had a tremendous amount of story and depth which, to me, seems fair taking into consideration the aftermath of Avengers: Infinity War.",1
The first half of the film was boring and the second half was not as good as the first Avenger films or as Guardians of the Galaxy.,-1
"The first movie was WAY better.  Just wanted to get that off my chest from the start. There was to much sarcasm, jokes, and general nonsense throughout the movie.  While the first film had you on the edge of your seat, this movie seems to do everything it can to take the nervous anticipation completely out of the film.  The middle of the movie REALLY dragged on.  My wife was actually glad she needed to use the bathroom so she'd have an excuse to step away.  My wife and I are big comic book hero fans, and actually collect comic books together, but we were off and on board throughout the middle 1.5 hrs of the film.  They have this ONE chance to turn everything around to bring back those they loved, but every 5-10 minutes, the cast are making light of their situation.  It just really ruined the immersion, and tension that SHOULD have been surrounding their perilous journey.  Captain Marvel/Brie Larson felt SO out of place in the film.  They literally threw her into every scene she was in, but it didn't feel as if she should be there.  There was no emotional connection to her at all even though she basically saved the Avengers.  The way the final battle went down up to the conclusion seemed rushed after having sat their for 2hr 45 min with little to no action.  After the final battle, the reminiscing sequence afterward lasted forever, and we were ready to leave once the battle concluded, but there's like 20 more minutes afterward that didn't feel needed.  Lastly, Ill only say that the sequence towards the end with Captain America passing on the reigns to another character was one of the biggest liberal pandering segments I have ever seen in a movie, and left a REAL bad taste in my mouth at the end.  Why can't films leave politics OUT.  So tired of it.  Anyway, I wanted to give the film a better score, but it simply doesn't deserve it.  We actually thought we'd go see this a few times like we did with Infinity War, but we have no interest in sitting through another minute of this movie until maybe its released on video.",-1
"The Good- There are a couple of clap worthy moments. Hawkeye, Captain America, and Thanos were good in this movie. ........That's all I got.The Bad- My god, so much. The script reminds me of my book reports from elementary school, hurriedly doing it the night before just so I had something to hand in. It appears the same approach was used here. No thought put into it whatsoever as it shows with horrible pacing, lazy dialogue, and the worst plot device to resolve the story (extremely lazy writing). Once powerful characters are reduced to pure comic relief (Thor, Hulk). They can have their comedic moments, but also show they can tear it up when necessary. They decided not to do that in their infinite wisdom. The force fed female/S JW agenda is on full display here having the women be the most powerful characters in the movie.This is done with the subtlety of being smashed over the head with a cinder block. For what is supposed to be the finale of 11years worth of movies, there is virtually no action because who wants to see that in a superhero movie? That took some David Copperfield-level magic to pull that off, but they did (slow clap). Brav-o. The movie also runs for an obscene 3 hours when 2 would have been fine. We needed to see everyone hug in all combinations. Essentially seeing the same scene five times.The emotional scenes miss like me using the toilet in middle of the night due to the phoned in script. This movie has the energy of an 88 year-old woman on a dialysis machine. A lot of low talking and me not caring.The Deal- This movie is as big a disappointment as the Phantom Menance was for me 20 years ago. The studio knew we would watch this movie regardless of what type of crap stew they brewed up. Sadly, had they stuck closer to the source material, this would have been a lot better. But the hack screenwriters thought that something that a high school student could come up would go over........and unfortunately, it did. This movie is all hype. Phase 4 will be an SJW gush-fest as prefaced here. They did not mention one of the stones in the movie......The refund stone.",-1
The hype the made about this movie was huge so I was ready for some treat only to find out that the whole 3 hour (was it?) story could be compacted into 40 minutes.,-1
The Incredible Hulk isn't very Incredible.Edward Norton gives a good performance but the concept of Hulk itself just seems tired. There is no new outlook on the hero just simply a repeatedly mediocre take on a very one dimensiona,1
"The long-awaited conclusion of the storyline started in Iron-Man 11 years ago. Looking at it like that its easily an 8/10, super satisfying for a fan like me and has a lot of moments that you will cry, clap and laugh. Although I believe the comedy could have been handled better, the movie doesn't focus on it as much as the other elements. You shouldn't look at this movie as a regular movie, you should look at it as the conclusion and if you haven't been following this universe this movie won't make sense, and won't hit you as hard. Overall 8/10",1
"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling off a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory.",0
"The most significant problem with this film is it lenght. For such short and simple story it has way too many dialogs and unecesary plot lines. They dull, uninteresting and sometimes senceless. It is just half cooked. Tried to make a grim story, didnt have the guts, cause of children. Tried to step aside from action and show more dramma, wrote very silly lines. It is by all means not a bad movue. It is just simply a borring one. Mediocre.",-1
"The movie is ""okay"", but can´t reach the same intensity like Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly to say, that the production team missed the opportunity to deliver a milestone in superhero cinema. The effects and the shooting is top notch, but unfortunately that´s not all. It just looked like ""work on schedule"". So, don´t believe the media hype and don´t set your expections to high. Entertaining, but nothing more...",-1
The movie is based on nonsense. I believe if one superhero can save the world then 10 of them would easily destroy thanos. So it's so stupid that these superheroes can't kill thanos. And where was captain marvel in avengers infinity war? did she have anything more important than saving the universe to do?,-1
The movie is OK. There's couple of characters and scenes that seem little bit or a lot(most people probably know what i mean)out of place and unnecessary. First Avengers movie was much better but this one is fun too.,-1
"The movie is pretty bad. The time travel mechanics make no sense, the choreography of the end fight doesn't make sense, it lacks any sense of geography (even Michael Bay fights have some), this is specially disssapointing because the Russo Brothers previous film did had some. In contrast this is an overcrowded mess, that is impossible to follow, I hate CGI generic debris, you can tell they were just hitting the air at a green screen. The main villian is such dissapointment from the previous film, such a downgrade, Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 comes to mind. For all the cameos, not a single contributes to anything, you could remove some and the plot would be the same,the dialogue is mostly interchangable among most characters too. Worse part is the conflict that made the heroes lose on the previous film, as well as the Pseudo-Civil War where nobody died), is resolved off-screen. Nobody learns anything they just win by facing the equivalent of a Baby version, that's cheating.Then everyone knows you shouldn't alter the past,.nor create alternate dimensions for selfish reasons. What this hero does, it makes Rick & Morty's Rick Sanchez look like a decent person. Is creepy. And resurectimg characters is always bad",-1
"The movie is quite good, with a few notable incongruous moments dealing with that ""timey-wimey"" stuff.  I wasn't a fan of how the Captain Marvel character was used at all, but some of my fears there did not come to fruition so I can handle it.  Most of the issues are minor, and it's a substantive and worthy conclusion, overall.",1
"The movie left a bad taste unfortunately.- Wamen power was pushed obviously in one ""in your face"" scene and of course in every scene captain marvel is in, it was distasteful- Captain Marvel being pushed into the movie with some reshoots is damn so obvious, you can clearly tell her scenes feel very off- Nothing explained about the infinity stones, no conclusion to why what happenned. No answers to what happened to Titan, no answers to the mistery in the wisdom of the stones- First half of movie is very emotional and satisfying- Robert Downey Jr's best acting in his carreer was in this movie- Why did Loki die? What did he mean by ""you'll never be a god"" or ""sun will shine upon us once more""? No answers. And he seems to be permanently dead.- Thor is the most wasted character in the movie. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him an alcoholic Zakk Wylde with broken character riddled by insecurities playing Fortnite! He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in the end he gave away what he already had as well, but what of his vision in Age of Ultron? What of his wisdom that pushed him off to go searching for infinity stones?- Movie feels to be changed dramatically after a sudden change of mind and if there is multiple cuts / alternatives for this movie this is not the best one among them, for the depth, immersion, feeling of a structure do not exist in this movie. All the characters and events are miles wide, inch deep.- This Thanos is not the same great antagonist we saw in the IW. He is shallow, insensitive, as a matter of fact, shallower than Ultron.- Action scenes are too chaotic, the fight sequences that focus on characters we saw in IW do not exist in this one. Just too much blend CG.When I came out the theater I asked myself: ""Are these the same guys who made the Infinity War?""",-1
"The movie starts off fine untill the time travel **** , seriously , 5 years after the snap Antman arrives and says to go and make a time travel machine ( without any project or relevant idea ) and everyone acts like no one ever thought of that before , Stark than proceed to develop it overnight . Seriously , a 14 years old could have written a more plausible plot. Skip over a pretty useless middle section of the film and then in the final battle Thanos challenge all the avengers + the 5 infinity stones  , basically alone + his army .Stark can develop in one day a time travel machine but can't decide to use only 1 stone to kill Thanos , instead uses all 5 for no reason at all and suicide . ( Anyway it's not possible that hulk used the power of the 5 gems to resurrect half of the universe and recives almost the same ammount of damage that Iron man get to win a battle killing AT MAX a couple of million of beings xd ) . I expected a lot better writing . You can find a better plot in h*ntai",-1
"The movie that confirmed reviews and how earning mean next to nothing. If you've watched these movies over the years, you're going to see this or you already have. Do you know what doesn't matter? Everything else.Pro reviews citing cinematography or pacing; pointlessPacing issues? PointlessActing? PointlessThere is a 10 year 20+ film Plot and Story Arc coming to a close, nothing else mattered. You might as well tried describing the size of a fathomless void.With that said, great movie, tons of fan service, tons of callbacks. The movie was the perfect dessert to a wonderful 7-course meal.",1
"The movie was bad. Not meant for people who actually care about marvel. It contained a lot of plot holes. It was boring. In a lot of scenes I was like, why did they do this? It was filled with a bunch of cheesy jokes. They just dragged the movie so much. Infinity war was amazing but this was just bad.",-1
The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed. Overall i am unsatisfied with how Endgame went and i do not agree with the high ratings its been given just for the sake of it.,-1
"The only plus to this movie, and the only reason for score 1 in stead of 0 is ... no, it is 0. The makers of this movie have failed miserably. It is difficult to make such a movie work, with so many characters, but they get an F nonetheless. They could have done a much better job. Let me repeat one thing about superhero movies. They are inherently dumb. The whole premise is just dumb - people with superpowers. But it's a wonderful fantasy - people with superpowers. That's why the creators must put in extra effort to mitigate the dumbness by making the best possible story. Some superhero movies do a better job at that than others. This one does not, and I rank it really low, along with 'Thor - The Dark World' and 'Batman - The Dark Knight Rises'. I shall only mention two things out of many, that make this movie so awful: Thor and Feminism. Let me address both. Thor, one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics and the great Dignitary, has generally been portrayed terribly in the movies - all of them, with the possible exception of Infinity War. First, he's been bland and a spoiled brat in Thor - part one, then he's a stupid, uninteresting oaf through a couple of movies, and then they start introducing clownish aspects to this character, which culminates catastrophically in this movie with fat, drunk, whiny, bum Thor. It is unforgivable. To make things even worse, they don't even let him get in a single blow against Thanos in the final battle. He just gets brutalized by Thanos, and Captain America basically takes over his supposed role, and battles Thanos properly. In the end, they put him with the Guardians of Galaxy. Since they are a bunch of clowns, he's should fit right in, but another problem there is that Chris Hemsworth is simply not funny. Maybe he could have been very good for the role of Thor, had they written the character properly, but he's no comedian, however hard he may try. I guess some people thought that he was very funny being shocked and zapped, he was not.As for the feminism: I like feminism. I also like a good sandwich, but if you shove it violently down my throat, I am going to hate that particular sandwich, and I'm going to hate you. I am talking about that scene during the final battle when ONLY female characters come together to support Captain Marvel in whatever she was trying to do, I don't care. If you desperately want to push societal issues in what is basically a lowbrow superhero movie, you should nonetheless try to make it less painfully obvious and stupid.MCU finale is a total fail. I watched it, many people watched it, you'll watch it, but it is bad.",-1
"The only reason to see this movie is for its climatic final act. Everything else leading to this is just an exercise in futility. Perhaps left to smarter writers, the whole time-travel, alternating timelines idea could've worked; but here it's just a mess.",-1
The opening sequence with the death of Thanos forced the audience to throw out any preconceived notion of what was going to happen.,1
"The Perfect end to an amazing film franchise. Movies tied everything up perfectly and left the fans satisfied with the outcome. Despite its 3 hour run time I never found myself bored and when the end credits rolled felt it could have been longer no problem. Stand Out performances from many of the original Avengers, along with great performances by everybody else. Thanos is one of the best villains of all time and does not disappoint to watch.",1
The previous one was much better this one is just a fan service. Iron man acting was disappointing I found myself laughing on his death scene. Thanos didn't make sense like the previous avengers...they made him the tpyical bad guy kiLl AlL pEOPlE...,-1
"The script and the forced ""humor"" really are a turn off. Just like Infinity War, this is another movie that - though technically polished - lacks substance. I guess 10-14 year old kids will enjoy this movie a lot.",-1
"The second best superhero movie I've see, after infinity war. Takes a while to get going, lots of false finishes and trips to the past, but overall a very fine send off for iron man and captain america. Three hours long, but the time flew by. Marvel are knocking it out of the park at the moment, I can't think of a better way to find escapism at the movies.",1
"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years.Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"".Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films.After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga.The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do.",1
"The storyline was eh, the action seemed rehashed from other Avenger movies, several hidden agendas, the time travel thing didn't fully make sense, characters were overpowered at times, things just didn't add up, overall disappointing and doesn't live up to the quality of the other Avenger movies.",-1
"The things that I didn't like about Infinity War are alive and well in Endgame.Too much mindless action, not enough good story.Too many characters and none of them had any presence.I spent the whole movie waiting for the Stan Lee cameo and all I got was a Marc Maron flyby.As an old school comic reader, the power levels of most of the heroes in this movie are really annoying.Middle of the pack as far as Marvel movies are concerned.",0
"The time has come. The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)  to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend,  Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It  put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+",1
The worst possible ending with natasha romanof death tony stark death and old capitan america with one handed hulk,-1
The worst work that has been done by Marvel. If you want to waste 2.20 hours for dialogs and only ~ 40 minutes to see the fight that doesn't cost it.,-1
"There are way too many plot holes in this work of fiction to even understand what's going on. The movie spends so much time building its own time-travel logic to end up breaking its own rules at the end. This raises a lot of questions about things they could've done instead. Hulk accidentally discovered the secret of immortality and it was completely dismissed as a failure. There's also a lot of inconsistencies. Namely, Captain Marvel one shotting Thanos spaceship and later easily being thrown away by Thanos. Yet, even mundane characters could fight with Thanos on a similar strength for a while. Why didn't those other people one shot the ship if they all could? The movies are getting so ridiculous that some actors -too ashamed to continue- decided to opt out of the next entries by leaving their characters to die.",-1
"There hasn't been a ""bad"" Marvel movie. They have all been well made. Even the couple that I didn't really care for aren't awful. This movie is better than both of those, but it's still not in my top 5. The plot is too simple. There are no story surprises. Reminded me a bit of Return of the Jedi in that regard. I would like to say thanks to Scarjo and RDJ for still being pros after all of these years. They are both very good here.",0
"There is a LOT in this film that pulled me out of the experience and made it less great than it was supposed to be. I would write everything down here if the user reviews didn't have a 5000 max character limit. This film is one of the best (if not THE best) Marvel movies, and it's a wonderful experience that everyone should see. But it makes mistakes, a lot of them actually, and as small as they are, combined together they make a serious blow on the movie overall and lets you out of the theater with a bit of aftertaste in the mouth. In a way, it's everything we hoped the last Avengers movie would be, but at the same time, there's a lot we hoped there wouldn't be. I have mixed feelings of complete enjoinment and fulfilling with sadness and anger of some the choices that were made.",0
There isn't enough words to describe the magnitude of and impact of such a worthy and excellent conclusion to the 22 movie saga the MCU has created congratulations to the superb cast and crew of the movie and the directors and producers for making such an amazing movie that transcends the heights blockbuster hollywood movies have achieved over a decade looking forward to more MCU movies and the ETERNALS,1
"These are my thought's. They killed off or retired any character that would have overshadowed Brie and the next MCU phase characters. It reminds me of my love affair with the season one of Macross saga aka (Robotech) anime from the 80s When that series ended with earth decimation I held my breath for what was to come after, and what came was a poorly constructed story minus my favourite characters. I don't not like this film, and I couldn't hate it if I tried too. Its a movie packed with fan service and a decent send-off I suppose. ""But I will be retiring with my favourite characters, and not returning for more. Let's hope the DCEU and Joker film will embrace me warmly."" Salute to the newer viewers Disney is making the films, for now, I hope they enjoy. truly Thanks, Russo bros",0
"These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",1
"They fricking did it, from start to end it's an emotional punch in your face.",1
"They got so many things right... then turned around and got so many things wrong.If I had to guess there were many disagreements about how to go about this movie and it shows in the writing/pacing.Im sure this movie will go down in the record books both in money made and ratings, but there are so many movies in the MCU that are better written and better executed.Ill watch it again once it comes out on dvd and see if a second viewing changes my opinion.",-1
they just made hulk wack hes even weak now so I did ot enjoy this movie at all,-1
"They said it would never happen. They said it would never be accomplished. But WOW,they’ve done it. I finally had a movie where the Italian Audience reacted to it like an American Audience,and it was glorious. Truly unforgettable. Anywho,the review.Yeah,it’s good. What did you expect? This big culmination of 10 Years worth of 300+ Movies to suck? You must love Jurassic World 2,then.All jokes aside,Avengers Endgame is a beautiful movie that somehow still puts the entire population in the world (Infinity War being just an anticipation of that) as main leads,and still make it a time at the theater full of poetry. Poetry that,for a Marvel movie,is still surrounded by sheer “MCU Formula” stupidity. Not as a whole,though.For a story that lasts 3h2’,this manages to go by pretty fast,like a 50 Minute TV Show Finale,even for one that deals with the casualties that Infinity War had,and just like final franchise movies,they mention almost the entire MCU,right down to the first Iron Man movie being an instrument for the story. The story goes by just like you thought it would go,and much more. Yes,there’s Time Travel (I’m allowed to say it,because other critics mentioned it),yes,there’s the traditional Marvel Formula (even if it lasts for,like,15 minutes in this hulking bowl of Seriousness) and it has a pretty easy structure to follow,which is surprising,considering that 3000 Characters and Time Travel in a Franchise movie are the recipe for a Box Office Flop. Several times they either repeat the same ole’ moment from *Insert MCU Movie name here* or they hint at that. Come to think of it,the structure of the story goes just like how Tony Stark has a great idea and it goes south real fast (remember Age Of Ultron? Good times…).The score by Alan Silvestri is alongside Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther at being the best MCU Score. At parts,it’s reminiscent of Forrest Gump (with the gratuitous melodramatic Violin or a piece mostly composed with Violins like the Theme or “They’re Sending Me To Vietnam”),and like every Final Movie in a Franchise,there are pieces from IW that are repeated in here (“Undying Fidelity”,”Even For You”,there’s a few...).If it has a shot at it (and unless another movie blows me away with that),this better have a Best VFX nom at the Oscars. So many pretty things (and CGI) to talk about in here that I can’t because it’s “Oh So Spoilery!”.But not everything is flawless,as this movie has some flaws that pissed me off A LOT. The First Act of the movie is enjoyable,but there are 2 jokes where they try to modernize it,to the point to where I’ve never thought a Marvel Movie could beat Ferdinand for a Dab joke (and you know I despise those things SO GODDAMN MUCH),and every minute of its runtime is pure Fan Wish Fulfillment,with a big,loud,bombastic 3rd Act that’ll make Nerds real happy. Just let me watch a movie,I don’t need a quote from a comic every 3 Seconds!Thanos got downgraded from the biggest threat of the MCU to “still threatening,but kind of an imbecile”. They try to make him as hateable as someone like Drago Bloodvist (from the How To Train Your Dragon series),but it ends up being a traditional ethic villain that threatens (I MEAN IT) to destroy the entire Galaxy with everything he has (a snap is not enough,huh?),with one decision in general that kinda made me angry,but still hope it’ll improve upon rewatch.Also,if you’re planning on an IMAX watch,see it in 2D,not in 3D. I almost had a headache for 3 hours of 3D Superhero Brawling.  But,aside from the jokes,what is there to really complain about? Just for too much Comedy and brutal decisions,I can see someone hating it a-la Last Jedi. SO MANY RISKS TAKEN IN HERE AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.But still,I had a great time,you’ll have a blast,your family and friends will,and everyone else will enjoy this epic conclusion in a Franchise that,ironically,half the world grew to love as time went by. This ain’t no Spider-Verse,but it’s the best thing the MCU could offer. Besides,I finally got to see an Audience bursting to tears (one girl holding them),so that’s a Big Plus for me. :-D",1
"They say they want to make a good story, 11 years marvel, or 11 years from several characters? really many hole plots, and lazy writing. the infinity war is very good, but endgames make urinating less painful than seeing their stories.I have to say, i have a mixing feelings, as the fan. the services was good, but as movie lover, it didn't",-1
"Thirty years ago, the critical and financial flop Howard the Duck was among the only comic book features from Stan Lee’s imagination. Then twenty years later, it took a total reversal to the capacity when Marvel has mastered the art of brainwashing people into numbly thinking their products, including their newest one, Avengers: Endgame, lands among the greatest Hollywood productions ever (just look at IMDb’s top 250 for crying out loud). But in truth, this is no different than anything else the MCU urinates, and yes, that includes The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark World.The time travel genre of this finale to phase three explains plot holes by mocking similar movies, yet still winds up far more illogical than Back to the Future, The Terminator, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and all others of such. The random sequence arrangement between the multiple heroes who jump through multiple places in time turns tedious, but not nearly as tedious as when they explain then re-explain stuff through massive information dumps that continue even after the climax. The atrocious script confuses the average viewer beyond wanting to care as it shoves aside an important character death two-thirds of the way through to make extra time for awkward jokes and boring exposition.The first joke happens in a very serious conversation where multiple lives are discussed as being at stake, then bam: Tony insults Rocket with intention to generate a chuckle. Among the more awkward jokes thrown around includes one of how nobody knows who Ant-Man is while everybody knows who the Hulk is. Except that joke doesn’t really work, not only because it has nothing to do with the plot, but mostly because everybody on earth now knows Ant-Man. This imbalance between drama and comedy is just chaos unworthy of celebration, which can’t even carry any intelligence throughout a sentimental San Francisco memorial for the Snap victims.Anyone deeply committed to the series could mostly likely by now be terribly sick of the cut-a-second editing and nauseating handheld camera, which here gets so bad it diminishes any impact of the bloated “sudden death” climax. Not to mention there’s drawn out music that never changes its style—a heavily American score that makes the already racist depiction of a Japanese assassin much more unacceptable. The music can’t even make a smooth transition between scenes, not that there could be one to start with, most of the “sad scenes” transition to upbeat scenes on a dime… at least Captain America 1990 stayed consistently cheesy.Out of complete fairness though, the problems of humanity start things off in this production as best as they can. It starts when Hawkeye’s daughter vanishes after an archery lesson, then develops it further as it shows how the dark fate of Tony seems to be booked, until Captain Marvel saves him. She’s in here for only a total of about two minutes, but Brie Larson has improved her horrendous performance from the last movie, which is enough to make the first two scenes of this movie relatively effective.In fact, all of the actors are better than before thanks to the more heartful attempts against urgent problems this studio wants to comment on. Mark Ruffalo is now at his funniest based off how high his character rises, as is Chris Hemsworth, based off how low his character drops. It’s like they both accepted the fact that they’re stuck in a skittles-level narrative, and it only took them eight years to finally make the most of it without phoning in their performances! That little motivation the Russo brothers express uplifts the somewhat brilliant comedic effect when watching clever flashbacks to previous movies, which triggers effective tension.Don’t be fooled though, those behind this production still willfully deny whatever trouble they caused, particularly in how much they dishonor our own spirituality. It’s easy to neglect the individuals within this three-hour blitz, considering they are impossible to count by now. Because Disney isn’t even trying to tell an actual story, Thanos‘ complexity disappears from his last appearance. The heroes honestly showed more layers of opinion and conflict without a villain, much like in one of the MCU’s finer films, Captain America: Civil War, it would be better to return to that level of risk-taking instead of this blatant fanservice.Geez, the deeper I review such a popular insult to art like Avengers: Endgame, the angrier I become about what some choose for fulfillment! It’s recommended not to support writers who crank out a billion dollars without even trying. Eventually their true colors will show, and ultimately reveal the wrong in giving up money to Mickey Mouse. If “you are what you watch” is true, then wasting three hours here will give the effect of a trash heap on those who worship the red logo.",-1
"This film was could've been one hour shorter than what they made it, so it got super boring in some parts and it felt like nothing was happening most of the time. I lost interest in the movie about an hour into it. And it was way to complicated to keep up with a of the characters and their relationships and separate missions and desires. this movie also had way to many jokes, this is a problem because it was trying to be a serious movie. I am fine with a little bit of jokes in fact that's what every movie needs but this one had way to many and every time there was a serious or sad character moment it would turn it into a joke, so I just wasn't able to take the movie seriously and after a while I just got tired of listening to all of these cheap jokes. Over all it is OK but it has too many flaws to say that it is good.   6/10",-1
"This final...this epic, it is not transferable! This film is a must-see! Spoiler! I still can't get over Tony stark's death!",1
"This is a classic case of being overwhelmed by hype and desperation for a good piece of writing that our subjective views can outweigh the objective truth of the film. Initially, I wanted to give this film an 8 or 9, but now I am thinking 6 or 7 are more appropriate after multiple viewings.Robert Downey Jr. by himself, is one of the main reasons to watch this movie, he is at the top of his game, his character arc is meaningful and impactful, and all of his interactions in the movie are heartfelt and excellently delivered, especially when it comes to conversations with Captain America, Peter Parker, and his own father.This film also boasts a hefty amount of fan service by bringing all of our favourite heroes together for one last time and it was a treat to watch. All the usual character interactions, funny dialogue, and nicely-timed one liners are present and land properly, with minor exceptions, and this movie certainly does make for a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Unfortunately, this film also became littered with plot conveniences, inconsistencies, and holes, the moment it decided to introduce time travel. This is always an incredibly tricky plot device that many movies struggle to implement properly, and this film is no exception. Time travel will always open up a million scenarios of ""Why didn't they do this, at this point, to achieve this?"", and it ultimately hurts the storyline as a result.Some characters also seemed to get worse in this instalment. The Hulk, is now a weird human hulk hybrid who is competent with his science (not enough for time travelling), able to control his temper, and is busy dabbing in cafés. Thor is now an overweight, disheveled shell of his previous self, who spends his time drinking and injecting awful Fortnite and online gaming references that won't age well. Thanos is more of angsty teen with emotional issues, rather than the intellectual and maniacal prophet he was in Infinity War, which was one of my favourite MCU characters. Captain Marvel is back and causes more damage in her 15 minutes of screen time than any superhero ever, big sigh on that one.The big battle was a bit too short for my liking, especially considering the buildup and hype it received from its previous instalments, but was still ultimately entertaining and fun to watch. Also have to mention that outside of Tony Stark, Rocket & Nebula were my favourite performers in this film. Rocket, for the comedy, and Nebula for the internal conflict and character arc. I thought most characters were either average, below average, awful, or did not receive enough screen time to evaluate.+ Robert Downey Jr. and his stellar performance+ Rocket & Nebula were great characters+ Excellent special effects+ Emotional character interactions and payoffs+ Some well timed humorous moments+ Worth the theatre ticket price+ Gratuitous fan service- Slow start and awkward pacing- Plot inconsistencies, holes, and conveniences- Over abundance of poorly timed humour moments- Awkward cultural references- Some characters are awful in this- Minor political injections- Captain MarvelOverall, this is a case of the Russo brothers having to do so much within a certain time frame, like closing all the character arcs, and it may have ultimately suffered because of this. Objectively: 5/10, Subjectively: 9/10, Overall: 7/10.",0
This is a good superheroes film but it can be an excellent movie if they removed the time travel element/plot from the movie. Time travel plot has been used so many times in entertainment media now it becomes so tiring to watch. I appreciated the effort to realize this epic 'masterpiece' but I can't give an excellent score to a film with cheap plot.,-1
"This is a hard review to write.  On the one hand Endgame has a number of exciting and unexpected scenes.  But I have never in my life been more disappointed with a movie.  First it's a full hour too long.  Lots of slow pacing trying to establish relationships that either were or should have been established 5 movies ago.  But the real problem with the film is it's inability to get you to suspend your disbelief.  Speculative fiction, science fiction and fantasy are anchored on a single idea.  There may be something fantastic, but it's internally consistent.  If I have a magic broom that lets me fly, it can't suddenly in the middle of story develop the ability to make pop tarts.  If it does, anything becomes possible and the story has no point.  Endgame is riddled with internal inconsistencies.  Because of that, suspending my disbelief became impossible.  Good acting, good special effects and a really poor script.",-1
"This is a tricky one to write when many people have still not seen the film, so no worries if you are reading this, there will be no spoilers. Look for the spoilers on The 602 Club podcast next Tuesday. If you listen to my podcasts or have read this blog, you know I am not afraid to be critical of Marvel movies when I feel it is warranted. Case in point, I felt like Infinity War was, “… a mixed bag that has the effect of one being served a gourmet burger and then only being given a minute to eat it. There is so much happening, yet there’s so little pay off, leaving the audience unfulfilled, wanting a better movie and resolution. We all know the conclusion is coming in 2019, so now that the compulsory is over, we wait and wait and wait.” It was frustrating to feel this way, specifically since I just didn’t feel much about the movie, other than ambivalence and this left me trepidatious for Endgame.So with that preamble, I know you are are all waiting eagerly for my thoughts on the end of the Infinity Stone Saga…. it is satisfying. That’s really what we want after this twenty-one film, eleven year investment, right? We want to be satisfied emotionally and thankfully Endgame is everything Infinity War was not in that department. The movie will capture you from start to finish. Personally I am happy with where my favorite characters are at the end and that is enough.With the three hour run time and the contrivances to overcome Thanos, there are some issues. The movie does feel a bit long, but it also plays out better than Infinity War. Where that movie left you feeling unable to focus because there were so many characters and not a moments rest, Endgame is able to take its time. This may be it’s greatest strength, that you don’t feel rushed, you’re allowed the opportunity to care about what’s happening because you’re not being whiplashed between stories every other minute. For my book, Endgame is the poignantly satisfying conclusion to this part of the Marvel saga I wanted. It is not the perfect movie but it’s the one we deserve. Endgame is rate 4 out of 5 Cap Shields.",1
"This is an absolutely breathtaking and emotional movie, containing the love of all the characters who were with us all the time through ten  years.",1
"This is an amazing film. I love almost every aspect of this film. As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Before I get started, here is a spoiler warning. Go see Avengers: Endgame and then come back. Let’s get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn’t like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn’t affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn’t work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it’s understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It’s sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it’s serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn’t anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn’t know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say “I am Iron Man” one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven’t seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion. I give Avengers: Endgame a 9.5/10.",1
"This is as good as popcorn films can get.  BIG BUDGET, big stars, big stakes...all that good stuff.  Is it the best movie ever made?  No...but it is one hell of a ride that we can all watch over and over and over again.",1
"This is my favorite movie of the year. I justgive 10 because it's how much i like him, because the quality of the movie deserves an 85. But this movieis epic, funny and one of my favorites.",1
"This is one of the best MCU films. On 2nd showing, now I see a couple of plot holes, questionable moments and an awkward moment.",1
"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched. And the #1 mandatory MCU movies you'll gonna watch. Literally hands down on the Russo brothers. And also, congrats on being #1 on all time highest grossing films of all time.",1
"This is over a decade in the making and delivers on most of the things I thought they'd touch on in this movie. While there are some inconsistencies in the plot but to say what those are would be to spoil it so I'll refrain from doing so here. The plot clearly doesn't want you to think too hard about some of the stuff happening but it does handle the subject matter very well. The length is a bit of a turn off, even though I'd be hard pressed to figure out what they could have cut from this movie. And the ending is very well done and moves the MCU into a new chapter. I'll be very interested in seeing where they go from here, especially since GotG 3, which was billed as the start of the next phase of movies, is going through such turmoil. But for fans of the MCU this is a no brainer and easily worth the lengthy run time.",1
This is probably the best mcu movie ever. Also the last hour of the movie is the best action set piece I’ve seen in movie history,1
"This is really the FINAL of Avengers who we know of 10 years in MCU. Excellent, dramaticaly, impressive. This film has so much fan service, plot twists, few humor and vision of new ""many-worlds interpretation"" of time travel.Also, I knew that the Scarlet Witch may kill a Thanos in solo",0
"This is the absolute worst marvel movie I have ever seen. I thought I was angry about the ""strong independent women don't need no man"" forcing. I thought I was angry about the inconsistencies. I am angry about the end of the movie, when Tony was at his weakest, barely managing to stay alive. Tony's wife indirectly killed him by telling them to give up and die. They had a chance of staying alive, you don't just tell someone they can die when they're barely conscious. Especially if it's someone their semi-consciously responding to. What actually happens when you tell someone that; They're a loved one and telling to die?; Must be better to die then. The absolute nerve and the ignorance. I don't even know how to describe this other than a massive betrayal from the character that doesn't even know they were the final nail in the coffin. I was personally insulted when they told him that, and a bit more when they cried after killing them. I would rate lower if I could.",-1
"This is the best movie made by marvel. It was the perfect combination of different elements throughout the MCU, and is a perfect wrap up to the infinity saga.",1
"This is the biggest fail I ever seen. I loved precedent chapters, I really wonder how they could change an awesome heroic adventure into a poor comedy with no action (6 minutes of fight on 3 hours? Less?) I can't imagine how Hulk's or Thor's fans are thinking about it... I'm really disappointed on this closure.",-1
This is the perfect conclusion to the ten year run of expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Everything came full circle.,1
"This isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't what I expected. There were so many sponsors which were shown in the movie undiscriminately (AXE, audi and Fortnite) except for the PS4 one. There was too much humour and there was a clear social and politic message which looked really obvious in the movie. The strongest avengers such as Hulk and Thor lose the uniqueness of their power in the movie and they are ridiculized while Captain Marvel is stupidly overpowered. The movie has too many stupid jokes and unnecessary scenes. The plot isn't very interesting and it should be more close to the comics. There are still many more mistakes to talk about but it could spoil some scenes. I'm giving it a 7 because of the special effects and the sound/music (even if it is too repetitive during the movie), also because it wasn't as disappointing as Captain Marvel. The actual score should be between 5-7.PD: What the hell is the last scene with Captain America and the way Thor looks?",0
"This movie brought me to tears; several times. When a movie cultivates that much emotion in someone, I declare it as an incredible work of art (or amazing marketing). It never ceased to entertain me and it interested me until the end. The only thing that keeps me from saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, or at least of the 21st Century, is that one must watch all of the 20+ movies beforehand in order to fully feel for the characters and be encompassed by the beauty of what the MCU has come to be. All in all, I would suggest this film to anyone, Marvel fan, movie fan, or bum (because that is the only other thing you can be if you are not the other two).",1
"This movie can only be described as one word...EPIC. The movie hits you with everything, high stakes, action, scream out loud moments and cry your eyes out moments",1
This movie deserves an award for best movie of 2019 and the 2010s decade it is just that good,1
this movie did not need to be as long as it was it could have been closer to 2 hours they dragged out dialogue a little to much and focused a little to much on character development but overall this movie was a good spin on the mcu it has a darker tone and supases they amount of characters that were in infinity war. the movie wasn't the best but it was what i expected and it ended on a good note and was a good experience watching it.,0
"This movie feels both like it was written specifically to subvert expectations and by someone whose only MCU experience was reading the script for IW. The biggest bother for me was that every main character is suddenly the opposite of what they've been built to be: Stark is suddenly a selfless family man instead of a selfish A-hole, Cap is suddenly a selfish A-hole instead of a selfless warrior, Hulk has been completely nerfed, in Ragnarok Thor became the God he was always meant to be and then suddenly he is depressed, fat and shirks his duty onto some rando we just met, we still haven't been a given a single reason to care about Hawkeye(other than his godawful haircut) or Widow yet I'm expected to have an emotional reaction when Widow sacrifices herself, Antman is borderline bullied throughout the film despite coming up with how to defeat Thanos and Thanos became a brainless megalomaniac instead of the superbly written antihero he was in IW. The time travel plot was pure deus ex machina laziness and there is no way in hell the Tony Stark from the previous MCU movies would sacrifice himself like he did that just isn't who he is. If the goal was to shuffle out the old blood for new blood than they should have stuck with IW's ending which would have been a perfect setup for a whole new MCU. I gave it a zero because honestly the whole film seemed to be a lazy attempt to wrap up lose ends as quick as possible rather than giving fans a memorable ending to a decade worth of world building.",-1
"This movie had GLARING plot holes and character inconsistencies but i'll focus on just Cap here.   How did he show up as an old man?   If he was able to go back in time and rewrite things, which is what they tried to explain was not possible, then how did he go back and marry Peggy?   Also,  Tony just died and the universe was just attacked----and he decides to sit on the bench after that?    Also,  how did he return the stones in it's original form i.e. the space stone back into the tesseract.   Once everybody calms down you'll see that this movie was a gigantic mess that the Ready Player One climax does not make-up for.    Act 1:  Leftovers TV show  Act 2:  Back To The Future/Time Travel that fails to stick to it's own logic  Act 3:  Ready Player One/fan service.",-1
"This movie had it all. I don't think it is any better than Infinity War but I don't think the two should even be compared. It's really a 7 hour movie, or a 7-episode final season of a TV series. What a way to end it.",1
"This movie has 4 mentionable issues, two small and two big, but overall it's a fun, entertaining, exciting, surprising at times, and emotional. Small issue #1. The Captain America Vs. Captain America fight could have easily been prevented by future Cap saying something only Cap would know. There's a better way to do that scene. Fight first then future Cap states only something Cap would know, ending the fight. Small issue #2: Pacing of the first act. At 3 hours, the movie mostly moves at a nice pace, but there was a bit of lag at the end of the first act. Big (and biggest) issue #1: Thanos finds out about the plan because past Nebula is on the same ""network"" as future Nebula?!?!? Future Nebula would know that might be a risk and/or would tell that they were reading her memories when she got to the past. That's really lazy writing and it the main plot point of brining Thanos into the fight.  A better way to do that is have either future Nebula infiltrate Thanos and get caught or Thanos intercepts the future Avenergs messages and is concerned enough to investigate and ends up catpuring future Nebula. Big issue #2: The ending with Cap on the bench and Bucky and Falcon watching him. In this scene, if there's one person who's going to approach Cap it's Bucky or both of them, but not Flacon. I mean they even made a whole movie about Bucky, not Falcon. Secondly, if Bucky would have went over there, would Cap have given HIM the shield or told Bucky to send Falcon over? (I'm cool with Falcon being Cap BTW). That's just for starters. The team throughout the movie were trying to prevent messing up the timeline by changing events, but Cap does just that. He goes back and marries Peggy preventing her from marrying her original husband and having her original kids (from Cap: TFA). This is a huge time ripple. In short, because there's so much awesome, funny, and exciting moments, it raises up an structurally 6/10 film to an 8.",1
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. Right from the start till the very end, it delivers, in every possible aspect of brilliant filming. Its ability to pull at your heart string is only surpassed by the incredible action and breath taking visual effects. This has to be the absolute best Superhero movie ever made. By a significant margin.",1
This movie is excellent in almost ever way you can think of. The movie fells like fan service to all the long time fans and still is great for the new group of kids. Love this movie with all my heart.,1
This movie is great it ends all the story lines of the different characters. It packs an emotional punch and i cried my eyes out in the theater. This movies is a great ending to a big franchise.,1
"This movie is great overall. However, time travel gets confusing and at parts I got lost on the plot.",1
"This movie is one of the best comic films, and I'd like to give you viewers to make sure you watch this movie in the first time. It's a masterpiece and a great deal with sad and emotional sequences.",1
"This movie is slow, with an awkward plot, it's just a muddle of stupid references and cameos. Just plain boring.",-1
This movie is so amazing as it is but i hear rumours about the extended versions with some cut scenes which would have been amazing in the movie. But amazing wish it was 4 hours,1
"This movie is utter garbage... Timetravel ""This is not some back to the future bs"" - True, Back to the future was a masterpiece... This movie is just overrated and totally trash. I am a marvel series fan, but Endgame did everything wrong... 3 hours garbage. No plot convenience , no action... Without spoiling, that movie is horrible... Just boring and some of the worst and unsatisfying movies I have watched in years... Superstar cast... Boring predictable garbage...",-1
this movie is well_designed one but how much popular  it is! that is out of thinking3 less points because they always managed the story like a noob ( destroy half earth and bring it back in the future or kill units that will respawn like hell),0
"This movie isn't as good as what people say it is, but it's still a good movie. I feel like the plot isn't as strong as Infinity War. The movie has a lot of nostalgia, especially for MCU fans. Overall, it is good, not great, and it ended the saga with a bang.",0
"This movie may not be exactly how you want it, but it does the greatest possible job of making everything make sense.",1
This movie was 1 hour and 45 minutes of plot packed into 3 hours. Except for some good one-liners from Rocket and and several amusing references to other movie franchises the movie was a long slog to a predictable ending.,-1
"This movie was a huge disappointment. A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel about which I can talk for hours. I will rather not get into that to keep this review short. My next issue is with how they mishandled some characters. The most obvious victims to this, but certainly not the only ones, were Hulk, Thanos and Thor. Even humour was not working. You have to make sure to not cross a line when something instead of funny becomes annoying, cringey or even outright disrespectful and offensive. I feel like they failed at finding the right balance in Endgame. The butt of almost all jokes became Thor. Instead of making him funny though, like in Ragnarok we loved, they made us to laugh AT him. They simply turned one of the strongest characters in MCU into a joke and scrapped like 10 years of his character development when he just gave up on his people. That was cheap. Another thing that kept me bothering were the SJW moments. As a woman I love to see strong female characters, but this felt forced. All in all the movie is in my humble opinion a mix of lazy writing, fanservises, and a lot of money that went into its production in hopes that under all that glitter and expensive CGI people will not notice just how weak the plot is. And it seems like it is working.",-1
"This movie was a huge disappointment. A mix of plot holes, inconsistencies, paradoxes and logic defying rules of time travel.",-1
"This movie was amazing from start to finish. It was filled with heart, action and altogether a great sense of closure. Although there were some plot holes scattered throughout the movie and slightly less Iron Man fight scenes than I would've hoped for, it still ticks practically every box that I was after and is a great sendoff to the Avengers franchise.",1
This movie was okay. I am in love with thor because hes super awesome and sexy and captain america sucks i hate him hes so annoying. I was very disappointed with this movie because thor was fat and not sexy for almost the entire movie he barely fought. I almost cried when that idiot captain america was able to pick up thors hammer but i was even more mad when his eyes turned blue and he could do the lightning thing. Thor is way more awesome than captain america and in avengers end game it didnt seem like it. It was more of a comedy than an action and adventure movie. The ending was sad because my third favourite avenger iron man died I rly rly rly wish that it was captain america instead. But anyways thor is just super awesome and it would have been fine if he was fat for a bit then he was sexy and awesome again at the end for the fight scene but no he was fat and not awesome the entire time. I was super excited to see thor be all awesome and his eyes turn blue and lightning strikes everywhere like when he came into wakanda in infinity war but nooooo he was fat and not sexy. And also i didnt like captain marvels haircut and the first 2 hours of the movie suck and i wish that they at least made all the superheros awesome for the end. But instead they made everyone but the strongest avenger (thor) awesome. And i also like black panther and he was in it for like two seconds and i love tom holland and he was cute in it but he was only in it for like two seconds. So pretty much thor rules captain america drools but for some reason they made thor fat and not awesome at fighting and not sexy the whole movie so im very upset but obviously i still love thor with all my heart chris hemsworth is the sexiest man alive,-1
this movie was so much **** i loved infinity war but this was garbage. the pinnacle definitive moment no spoilers is black widow and nighthawk trying to kill each other to prove who loves who the most.,-1
This movie was way too slow and too long. I don't mind a movie that is slow if it has great dialogue and characters. But I'm not a huge fan of most of the superheroes in Avengers. I think to enjoy this movie you need to be deeply invested in all of them. The only interest I had was with Thanos. The problem is the Thanos we seen for most of this movie had very little knowledge of all the superheroes he was fighting. He obviously had no knowledge of what happened in Infinity Wars. So the fight scenes didn't have as much weight to them as they should have. This was the biggest problem I had with them using time travel. Also time travel has been done so many times it just felt cheap and lazy. I'm also not a fan of them making Thor fat and making Hulk more human like. They are trying to get rid of all the best male superheroes. They also killed off Iron Man. They are full on SJW's putting down male characters and trying to make the female ones look better. I can't stand this trend with Marvel. You also get a scene with all the women superheroes on screen at once. It's too in your face at this point for me. I like strong female leads like Wonder Woman if done right. But Marvel goes about it the wrong way. The ending had some cool action scenes with some cool CGI. But that doesn't make a movie good. It's something that can help compliment a movie if everything else is good. But this movie was terrible in my opinion.,-1
"This movie wraps up the wonderful Marvel Cinematic Universe amazingly. It is very entertaining, intense, and emotional. The jokes aren't as good as in other movies, like Spiderman or Thor: Ragnarok, but they still exist. The plot wasn't what I expected and there are a lot of plot twists and entertaining characters. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and it is probably my second favorite Marvel Movie behind Thor: Ragnarok.",1
"This movie's plot is half-baked with lots of holes. Not a lot of action scenes, too much backstory about lives of superheroes. Thor did not really play an important part in the movie. Overall, it seems like the movie was a little cash-grab.",-1
"This one is a bit weird to judge.As a person who read alot of comics when I was younger, and have seen all the movies at least once, I was invested in the characters wich helped alot. Its alot of pretty good acting, but unless youve watched the earlier movies you wont understand alot of whats going on, and probably wont care. But for me? + : Good acting, good action and a fitting celebration to the last 10 years of movies.- : Not alot (from my POV)Neutral: the plot was a bit ... I dont want to say bloated, but a bit all over the place in the middle. And it was a LONG movie, for good and for worse.",1
"This one's great. Its the character moments that do it for me. They seem to tie things together well and even unmake a plot hole or two from previous movies (bad news, they're still plot holes in those movies!)Characters acted true to their character, although there was not enough Hulk, Thor was a bit disappointing and Catpan Sparklefingers was as sour and holier than thou as I assume she was in her own movie.",1
"This review contains spoilers...For a 3 hour movie there is surprisingly little action. Central characters like Thor and the Hulk did hardly anything and were just lame. Captain Marvel was supposed to be their knight in shining armour but she was hardly in it at all and at the end fails to best Thanos one on one, even though she's just blasted through the middle of a giant space cruiser. I really thought she would be his downfall. If you're going to hype her up that much, make sure she's really a solid element of the film. Too much dialogue, too many sentimental moments. Ending it on Tony's Stark's funeral was just a downer when really you wanted some real cathartic, happy times after the bleakness of Infinity War. It's not even clear how Stark gets the stones from Thanos as one minute they're lodged in this glove and then next minute Stark has them without you even knowing why. Annoying that Black Widow has to die and they couldn't figure out another way to get the soul stone. Hawkeye's rage filled murdering spree near the beginning feels kind of forced and weird. Stupid humour that went way over the top, like Thor becoming a complete loser. It was funny for the first five minutes but when you realised how much they'd nerfed his powers you just felt disappointed, especially after how badass he was in Ragnarok. He was almost discounted from contributing altogether and was just pathetic. Stark's banter with his daughter was just cringey. Why did hulk wearing the infinity gauntlet for 10 seconds manage to restore the earth again? That wasn't explained but maybe I missed it. This always happens, when the hype is so high things go the other way. Captain Marvel's movie was dire as well. For me, although DC have a worse track record, Marvel still haven't topped Wonder Woman. Their new joker movie looks top notch too. Just hoping Guardians 3 is good.",-1
"This review is an edited for size, repost from one of my blogs on wordpress. https://evergreentimes.wordpress.com/2019/04/26/what-a-finale/  Avengers: Endgame was nothing short of brilliant; it is a masterpiece in the genre of super hero films and is good enough to transcend the action movie sphere.There were a great many reviews suggesting the movie was long. But was it? Making reference to its length tends to lead the reader to believe that it dragged on. This film does not drag on, not at all. Never once during the entire 181 minutes, yes friends that is a minute beyond the three-hour mark, did I get that feeling of ""this is a long movie."" Not one time. Is it a long movie? No, no it is not. It is a three-hour movie that blows by like a two-hour movie.I still can't wrap my head around everything they were able to convey without losing the audience and without overwhelming it either. I have to say that the scene stealing in this movie is from an unlikely character. The Hulk literally steals the show. Thor is amazing as well but he is not what you expect this go 'round.I will have to view it again to really soak it all in but I will say it was not a perfect film if there ever is such a thing. Hollywood loves to do stupid stuff and Endgame is no exception. Tony shows up in an Audi E-Tron which is an all-electric vehicle and it is like other electric vehicles, silent. The director decided to have a roaring engine noise dubbed over for ""effect."" But Audi's E-Tron badge is enormous and in no way subtle, so it is just STUPID to have it roaring in like that! There, that's my complaint ;)It is hard to compare Endgame to movies in the past as I have the advantage of having seen those films before versus when I walked out of the theater after seeing Ironman in 2008, there was no Avengers to compare it to. I was comparing it to the movies that had come before it. Ironman was the first of the 22 films in the Avengers MCU Saga. Part of how these movies rank in my view is how I felt about the film after first seeing it. But also it is about how I feel about it later on, even years later. I still love Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, THIRTY YEARS LATER! That is why that film still rates so high on my chart. This movie however is tough to gauge because it is not a stand alone story. It stands on the shoulders of 21 films that came before it. It is also in effect, a ""Part II"" of the Avengers Infinity War. I feel like a major shakeup is coming on how I view these films and the impact they have. There are better films than this one if we separate the films from their companion films and look only at its stand alone value. Part of what makes this movie so good is the reference we have from the previous 21 films. When we look at the film as part of the totality of effort across all the associated and supporting content, Endgame is absolutely, Top Tier. All by itself however, not as much. But therein lies the reality, it does get the benefit of those prior movies.I still feel that Guardians of the Galaxy flows better and is more ""fun."" But this movie isn't supposed to be fun, is it? Yet in spite of the gloomy atmosphere that is the post Thanos Infinity Stone apocalypse, this movie is in fact fun. The movie will pay homage to the 21 MCU films that preceded it with a variety of scenes scattered throughout. It is rare to see an action oriented film that can produce moist eyes from tears of both joy and sadness as well as laughs like it is a good stand up routine. The movie weaves the plots of previous films into this film using what is likely some cutting room footage and it all manages to tie together nicely. Although there are a few hopelessly predictable scenes and outcomes, there are some genuine twists in how the Avengers manage to try and ""undo"" what Thanos had done. During the process of ""fixing"" things, Marvel manages to create some amazing scenes that are homages to the past, the way past in fact.This movie feels like an end, it really does. Yes, I know there is a Spiderman movie this summer and there will be a Guardians of the Galaxy III and a whole ""Phase 4"" of MCU, but it is a bit of an end. This film genuinely wraps up the whole MCU into a delicious burrito, dripping with cheese, and soaked in spicy sauce. And we the audience, just ate it all up. In the immortal words of Porky Pig... ""Th-Th-The, Th-Th-The, Th-Th... That's all, folks."" There were no special scenes during or after the credits roll. There will never be another original ""Stan Lee"" cameo. There is an almost foreboding finality to it. This really brings to close what may someday go down as the greatest series of motion pictures ever made. 22 films over 11 years all collectively formed into one epic saga the likes of which we have never seen before. It is quite possible, we will never see anything like this again. WOW what a ride! Thank you Stan Lee, may your stories and characters remain forever entwined in our hearts and culture.",1
"This review will have spoilers, I rate movie an 8 because it lives up to my expectations and I think it is money well spent to see this movie. But I still think that Infinity wars is a better and no Marvel or other superhero movies could reach that level. Infinity wars has an interesting plot to the movie when at the end of the movie characters feel lost and shattered by the love ones who are taken away from them. Endgame teaches you grief and how to move on and in my opinion that theme was used too much in the movie and was very overwhelming, but during this movie you can see the affect on the characters but not the other 50% of the Universe's population who are still alive. How bad is Thanos's snap? Is Earth's 50% population struggling from this incident? How are they holding up throughout this situation? How did the Thanos snap affect other countries politically? this is one of my complaints about the movie even though it's not that major. Another complaint that I have was during the end battle you see every hero come together and take on Thanos and his army, but Hulk was left out of this and we don't see him until Tony's funeral. I would've loved to see Hulk get back into the action even if it's only 5 seconds of him just smashing and throwing the villains like it's nothing. The only scene where Hulk does fight was when they went back in time and Bruce sees his 2012 self fighting the Chitauris during the first Avengers movie. And that's all I have to say about the movie I think that the movie is very decent and I can't wait to see the affects that everyone goes through without Tony Stark in the World.",1
"This serves as the conclusion to the entire Marvel universe Infinity Stones saga. Not that there aren't going to be anymore movies. Disney likes making money. But with several main actors' contracts being up and bowing out, this will be the end for several of the original Avengers team. What results is something we've never quite see in a film: a season finale, the culmination of a franchise of multiple movies, characters, and story arcs. (The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all!The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film.Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great.Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain.Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general.There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines.The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats.Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end.Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too.Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled.P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist.",1
This trash play more like culmination of toxic fanboys culture than a conclusionCompletely anti-cinema,-1
"This was a good movie, but it was not a great movie. Infinity War was a great movie. This movie was also an hour too long and plodded along at a snails pace for the first 2 hours. Tony Stark was not a surprise. Black Widow was a surprise. Captain America was perfect.",1
"This was an absolutely fantastic movie.I am not sure which Avengers movie, 2 or this one, I would choose as the top movie from the Marvel cinematic universe but it definitely is one of the best ones, one of the 2 top ones.First my main gripe, combined with an admirable effort:The writers use Bruce Banner to establish the axiom of how a Consistency Paradox cannot be occuring. And I am glad that they did that. You cannot overwrite something. You cannot destroy the existence of something by overwriting its state and thus also not overwrite the event that served as initiation of the overwrite itself.That was perfect.What was not perfect? Well, first of all, they used Multiverse Theory. That is bad, because it is also inconsistent but whatever - let's accept that, it fits the comics overall and is at least no Consistency Paradox. BUT the story tries to establish ""if we bring the stones back we dry out those time branches"" - what? No. Either they exist or they don't. Trying to ""dry them out"" would mean you would actually depend on the Overwrite Consistency Paradox which the writers so skillfully already cancelled out. Now IF they establish ""the stones were always brought back, we do not overwrite a timeline/delete it, we simply are talking about something that is possibly but never comes into existence"" then okay, then it would mean that within a timeloop they always brought back the stones after getting them. But they very well established that they want to get rid of the timelines so they were no talking about timelines that never existed in the first place. A timeline without a Thanos because Past Thanos travelled to the other branch will always exist. A timeline where Loki stole the Tesseract and fled will always exist and there is nothing they can do about it by bringing back the stones. At best they ""always brought back the stones"" and that's it. The timelines that we know definitely exist even if there might have never been a timeline ""without Infinity Stones"".Now this being said, I am glad that they at least tried and of course its fine that they at least tried to make an effort caring about causality but treating it like there are no other timelines now is just nonsense because from a chronological perspective and the establishment ""we cannot overwrite/delete things"" they very clearly (and realistically) could not do anything about that. The timeloop by the way was also sloppy because Cap cannot bring back the stones in their original state so he definitly ""has not always brought them back to his own timeline"". I do not know if they forgot about that but I can turn a blind eye on that because they really tried other than other movies and Tony's fate was heartbreaking but he got a solid sendoff, so did Captain America. It is great how the movie ended with him giving him ""a second chance"", but I think the writers wanted us to just think about the joyful side of this because the reality is: Even that was another timeline. Captain America had a life with an Alterative Magaret. His own Margaret still became an old, lonely lady in his ""home timeline"" and that is pretty sad and depressing for both.Well, nevertheless for what the movie tried, establishing good character scenes with all kinds of emotions, wrapping up things (even if not completely correct but the effort was here) and offering spectacular finale to this story arc it did a absolutey fantastic job.By the way - there was no solid reason why they could not snap their own set of Stones back into existence. On top of that: i understand why they cannot bring back Gamora and Natasha as they ARE the Soul Stone but Vision existed together with the Mind Stone and Thanos already proved the Stone together with Vision can be brought back so they should have brought him back.I love it times 3000. By the way - half of the time travelling complaints here on this site come from ordinary pop-culture fanboys that have no idea of time phenomena, causality, et cetera. Just as the other half is from Thanos fanboys that really thought Thanos was a hero in Infinity War just because he ""wanted something good for 50%"" completely dismissing the psychopathic part of the character.",1
This was an amazing movie the acting was spot on. It had pretty much everything a great movie needs.,1
This was an emotional moving movie. It has lots of action and has your favourite superheroes!,1
"This was atrocious. Death has no meaning in this movie because the power of the gauntlet looms on your mind throughout the whole thing and then the movie pulls a random ""gotcha"" and jks on you your hero is dead.",-1
this was disappointing after the epic infinity war. they butchered thor and hulk's character,-1
"This was probably one of, if not the best, marvel movie I have ever seen. It was both exciting and hilarious, but also emotionally invested in its characters. So in other words, a fitting and well-made conclusion.",1
"This was the funniest Marvel movie yet.  Lots of funny one-liners which makes this an enjoyable film.  It is too long at 3 hrs and the first 30 min drags, but it picks up and gets you invested.  It does get predictable at times and is the quintessential Hollywood blockbuster.  I was surprised how plot heavy this installment was (not much action until the second half).  Overall, a fine conclusion to the Avengers story line and worth a watch.",1
"Though Avengers: Endgame is filled to the brim with heart felt moments, the logically mess cannot be ignored. The editing, pacing, and writing are a giant mess and no matter how many awesome visuals or big moments occur on screen, these major issues cannot simply be ignored. The Russos have finally made a mediocre at best film and I would not be surprised if studio interference was a part of it. You can subjectively love this movie, but you cannot simply ignore the plethora of narrative and character issues that are strewn throughout this 3 hour mess. C-",-1
"Thought this movie was good but a little bit more boring than its predecessor. Some of the ideas were a little wonky and convoluted. The acting was good though, especially from Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. The movie made me cry quite a bit as it was truly the end of an era. Iron Man’s death was brutal, and Tom Holland’s acting during that point made me actually cry. The action and comedy were as good as any Marvel movie. It was a fine ending to a 21 movie long era and the result, while not perfect, checked most of the boxes and was satisfying.",1
Time travel is the laziest style of writing. It is like the ridiculous force healing in Rise of Skywalker. A decent movie but not worth the hype.,-1
"TL;DR: Avengers: Endgame is a massive extravaganza film with a lot of enjoyable moments, but without soul, purpose, artistic vision, philosophy or literary value. It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming ""products"" by the Disney;Marvel brand.Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU.The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending.-RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable.-As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good.-In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event.The Bad:-Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples.As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose.-Direction:The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see.The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the ""past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos"" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some ""cool"" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem.In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: ""Yibambe""! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters.",-1
"To be honest, I was not expecting the plot of the movie to be with time travel. The movie was great, but some parts were not explained properly and they just lumped it to just a ""quantum theory"". Overall, it appeased the masses, both Marvel and non-Marvel fans.",0
"Tons of plot holes, but dammit, the fan service this movie give is tremendous.",1
"Too long and too full of plot holes.  This movie went on and on and did not do anything justice.  Nothing makes sense unless you are a die hard fan that wants fan service.  I was psyched about this movie and totally disappointed.  I do not remember being this disappointed with a Marvel movie in the last 10 years, but this was just bad.  I would not spend money to watch this move again.  At about 1.5 hours in I was staring at my watch wondering how much more time I had left.  I have never done that in any Marvel movie, especially an Avengers movie.  It made no sense and the timeline did not add up.",-1
"Too long. More of EVERYTHING we’ve already seen. High gloss, no real feeling. Did arrow guy have his own film? Why do I care about him again? Focus issues.",-1
Too long. Too outlandish. It got to a point where I no longer cared what was happening. This film is for me the weakest of the Avengers and certainly ranks towards the bottom of all Marvel movies,-1
"Too many plot holes such as the time travel,tony's death,capt america's peggy romance,etc.capt was my favorite avengers but the way he chose peggy over the greater good and being selfish(peggy already said she's happy with her life in the winter soldier) really gave the negative impression of the character for me.",-1
Too much of the film was spent on the dull sentiments and tedious character development that it was hard for me to enjoy it. At some point I even asked myself if this was still a superhero film or a drama.,0
"Truly an absolute masterpiece and breath taking superhero movie like no other! A magnificent journey down memory lane and a bitter sweet conclusion and farewell to some of our favorite heroes and characters. This movie ultimately sums up everything the MCU built up the past 11 years and 21 films, but still leaves more to look forward to even if it feels like the end. Truly a must see cinematic experience like no other! It will make you cry, laugh, wow, and feel, all your emotions will just pour out!",1
"Trust me, Disney ruined the future of the Marvel universe. It's fanboys fault!",-1
"Typical time travel plot holes only really effect the ending to a small degree, but the rest of the movie is mostly just fan-service instead of actual plot development.  Many other plot holes ranging from the tiny and momentary, such as Captain Marvel talking in space without comms (no atmosphere, no sound) just like these writers did with Thor in the previous movie, to claiming that the infinity gauntlet cannot do certain things which is oxymoronic, is just more of the same rushed writing we saw from the Russo's in Infinity War.  I particularly liked how nonchalantly the Iron Man glove becomes an infinity gauntlet, because nanites are as good as the magical forge that is driven by a Neutron Star.  But hey, CGI!  Even Rocket's quips were bland and unfunny.  The performances are great, the sound and cinemtatics are great, but the illogical plot points just make this a watch once and forget movie instead of the amazing climax to an era.  This drags down the enjoyment considerably.Without spoiling anything since we know the heros win (Spiderman: Far From Home)- The largest plot hole is what happens to all the people that moved on with their lives?  That ending cannot possibly be considered a good solution.  What about children that had no parents for all that time?  Now add in all the degredation to the world that the Russo's clearly show.  Then factor in that many of these people do not have homes, or bank accounts, or jobs.  The end result is slightly better than the start of the movie, but not by much.  Now the returned have to try to reinegrate... somehow.  But hey, CGI!",-1
"Unfortunately it's a trashy cash grab! I'm very disappointed as i had high hopes for the movie, esp since the previous ones were quite enjoyable.",-1
"Unfortunately, I can't agree with the majority here, I don't mean to offend anyone but I won't lie about my reaction to this movie either. Honestly, it was way too long & boring, I ended up not caring what happened in the end.  I kept thinking what excuse are they going to use this time to delay Thanos's eventual death.  Too many plot holes, farfetched and every excuse in the book to show case every character in the Marvel universe.  I was so glad when it was over.",-1
uninspired main plotboring at the beginningthe film stretches into the length,-1
"Unlike its predecessor, the last movie of this tetralogy (so far) becomes a dragging and tiring movie, simply because it is the climax of 22 films that preceded it.The movie is too long (3h01min), has several backstory, not taking advantage of 20% of them, and some characters are poorly developed, such as Rocket and Nebula.But not everything is lost. The script works very well the ending of the story of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johanson) and the other avengers such as Thor, Hawkeye and Hulk are left as supporting, but that add something to the story.Avengers: Endgame, tries to imitate the formula of its predecessor (Infinity War - 2018), but fails to deliver a cohesive script, leaving a bitter taste in the viewer's mouth.",-1
"Usually the phrase came full circle is used way to often without meaning but in the sense of Avengers: Endgame Marvel did just that, wrapping up 10 years of storytelling and movies all really well.What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot, Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it’s right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War.As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn’t say it’s a major issue it’s just that in a 3 hour runtime you don’t need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven’t said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now.Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn’t see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual .In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that’s another plus.Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn’t in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn’t in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn’t like what they did to him or his arc(if that’s what you wanna call it) was disappointing.The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn’t ruin the character of Thor but it’s like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn’t really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I’ll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo’s for a compelling and interesting story. Now let’s talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don’t describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I’m glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action.The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it’s not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you’d expect some lighter tones in some aspect. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes.So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn’t like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell I Thank You Marvel.",1
"Utterly pointless movie. Replace the last ten minutes of IW with the last ten minutes of Endgame, and you have everything of note in a single movie. Unfortunately a big step back from Infinity War. IF offered an epic plot with the fantastic worlds, that was made great by great characters. EG is emotional and character-based drama. The only problem is, emotions and characters are where EG fails. It is hard to believe those two movies were made by the same people. Bad script, bad direction, bad pretty much everything. Scenes and emotions flow without any regard to each other, scenes of sadness, abruptly replaced by comical ones. A lot of scenes that serve no particular purpose, other than cheap and stupid jokes in what is supposed to be a tragical/drama movie. Or vain effort to convey emotions or shoehorn something in. A man that is able to build a fusion reactor in a cave has to wait for a space taxi? Or that Hawkey/Widow thing. Why is Hawkeye willing to exchange his whole family for Widow? Survivor guilt, yeah, but other than that, why does he want to jump off that cliff? His haircut?Character-wise, I am of course not talking about Brian ""Deus Ex"" Larson, who is just a bad actress playing a bad character in bad scenes. I mean, it is almost funny, she is so OP they have to figure out how to keep her out of the story, because otherwise she would not only marginalise every other hero, but the whole story as well. So bad.Or Black Widow, cold-blooded killer who for some strange reason had a nervous breakdown and now rules the universe while surviving on peanut butter sandwiches. No jelly, that is how serious it is. And the movie is full of such silly and naive scenes one would expect from a college director. Well, it is about time travel after all, but still.It is the disgrace called Thor. Ragnarok/Infinity War completed his awesome story arc, he finished his journey, becomes the high king of the nine worlds (or something).In Infinity War, he had one purpose. To avenge his people and his family. But no! Turns out those 6 movies was not what Thor really wanted. All he really wanted was to tour the universe in a space ship!So instead of leading his people in moments of their greatest needs, he passes the throne onto a traitor and coward and run away to bully a man who lost his mother when he was 5, brought up by pirates and had to kill his own godlike father. Some people find that funny. I guess he was too awesome even for the WOMON POWA, so he had to go. WTF? Thanos Hitlerised into just an another egotistical maniac. Yeah, the reason why IF was so great? An actual antagonist! Constant bullying of Ant-Man was not that funny either. The more I think about it, Endgame is the new low for Marvel Universe. (Not counting Captain Marvel, I mean...) Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 style. Yes, Age of Ultron. I will have to think twice before seeing a Marvel again. The story direction is  completely wrong.",-1
"very bad movies , **** logic , fade story line waste of money and time ,waste of money and time ,",-1
"Very bad Thanos. Thanos was the very nice character in the infinity war. he was with the motivation  (the inhabitants of his land were killed) and he wanted to kill half of the entire universe, but in the endgame he just wanted to destroy the planet just because he is",-1
"Very disappointing vs. the great Infinity Wars. What happened to all the witty dialogue? The writing was just plain poor this time around. It felt like the writers were lazy and took the audience for granted. Cheap fat jokes just don't cut it in this movie. Instead of the joy we felt watching Infinity Wars (and the first Avengers movie), we felt one big ""meh"" after watching this one. With very few exceptions, the interesting character interplay and humor that was present in Infinity Wars was absent in this one. It's frustrating to see this movie getting such great reviews from ""professional"" reviewers. With all the money spent and made with these films, couldn't they hire good writers?",-1
"Very Dissatisfied!Written April 26, 2019I don't understand why they felt the need to teardown the characters from our childhood in an effort to make others stand out. It's truly sad to think that the ""feminist"" aspect of this film doesn't believe enough in their own power to stand WITH their male counterparts without first changing the ""strongest"" characters at their core. There were so many times they tried to deliver humor that was strained, and too many plot holes for a 3 hour film. Finish with an ending that truly disappointed my kid. My 12 year old says he's now a DC fan!",-1
"Very entertaining. One of the best from Marvel, but it can be boring and have lots of plot holes, but it still deserves a watch, superhero fan or not.",1
"Very good overall though a little too long, the 'Time Heist' was a bit silly and some characters got too much screen time at the expense of others e.g. the awful Nebula is critical to the plot while we don't really get The Hulk.",1
"Visually amazing but a mess. It just seems that whoever wrote this was trying to cram in a list pre-determined ideological goals. I found myself laughing upon numerous occasions, but not to any scripted humour other than Korg who is brilliant, but to the more cringe worthy parts. Four points go towards visual and effects team, awesome work, oh and Korg.",-1
"Walked out after the pathetic anti Trump comment! I'm in the UK and don't care who is this president of the USA but what I do understand is respect. There is no room for more childish behaviour from Hollywood. They have the opportunity to to take the moral highground but this just leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The Avengers franchise has been tarnished by such a cheap, childish stunt.",-1
"Watch the preceding movies that were actually good. Not this **** collaboration of everything. Plot summary: 2, 5 hours of crying and talking about everyones feelings.. That nobody cares. 10 minutes of action and the rest is generic **** I mean what were they thinking. Only people who like this movie is a serious fanboy in denial that this is a total dissaster. At least infinity war was ok but same time also bad because there was NO character development since there was 200 characters. The only thing good  about this movie was the overweight thor puns.",-1
"Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies to be a great movie. I have always been a Marvel fan , but this is unreasonable. The time conundrum's not withstanding , I feel , the Hulk and Thor were both pushed aside. Capt. Marvel is way too OP and Capt America wielding the Hammer better than Thor? Tony Stark wielding the Gauntlet that the Hulk couldn't take? Convenience is not a good excuse for poor storytelling. Don't even consider the time element. Nothing more than a money grab by Disney and Marvel. Sadly , the fans will flock and they will feel justified. The most important part of any movie is the story. It seems harder and harder to find a cogent and entertaining movie nowadays. Hundreds of millions of dollars and this is the story they come up with? Again , a fan of Marvel since childhood , I feel betrayed. As a child , I mowed lawns so I could buy my favorite Marvel comics. Hated DC and still not really receptive to their stories or characters. I felt the same way with The Last Jedi. So maybe it's a Disney thing. In summation , this movie is truly disappointing for me. A lifelong Marvel fan , maybe it's time to watch something else.",-1
"Way, way, waaaaaay, way, way too long. Nothing else is even worth mentioning because it's 3 times longer than it should be.",-1
"We asked for it, we got what we wanted. There are loads of moments where it's just fan service, but they fit fairly well into the plot. The overall story was engaging although a little slow at first, and damn, that was an emotional rollercoaster. The ending for one of the characters didn’t particularly make sense, especially considering the rules of time travel in the MCU, but the final battle was breathtaking. Overall, if you’re not an invested fan, this experience isn’t for you. Form an emotional connection to these characters and you’ll realise just how intense the film is in what it chooses to do.",1
"Well like I said before, I was expecting so much better than this but I guess this what you get for 20 years of wait",-1
What a great ending to an epic saga! I knew from the start this was gonna be a tear-jerker and they sure didn't disappoint!,1
What a movie! Well worth the wait. I can't wait to see it again. It was hard not to let the tears flow with such an epic climax to 21 movies. I loved everything about it and was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen.,1
"What a rollercoaster ride the movie Avengers: Endgame was! Even though it has some slow scenes, I was really moved by the character building, how the story was elaborately planned, and the heartbreaks that we had to endure along the way. I must say, it had an epic and emotional ending we never thought we wanted.",1
"What a slog! More like ""Avengers will never End...game."" I haven't been this bored since Barton Fink. This movie is SOOOOOOOO unrealistic its not even funny. I'll give it a few points for Rocky Rakkoon, because rakkons are my favorite animal. Is this the last one? Can we be done with this? Please. Its starting to hurt..",-1
"What a terrible way to end the MCU franchise. Story made no sense and the way they executed the plan made even less sense.  So many plotholes you I would not know where to start, nothing made sense except for the fact this entire movie was a setup to introduce the next characters in the MCU, which seem to be all female and most have had less than an hour of screentime in the last 10 years of MCU movies. I'm glad this is over as I am done with the MCU for good.",-1
"What a way to conclude the first chapter such a thrilling movie. The acting was really good I really just want to watch this movie over and over again,",1
What an unbelievable accomplishment to have shaped the previous 21 movies and end it here in the most beautiful perfect way possible. Endgame is the be all and end all of MCU movies.,1

"When last we were with this group, Thanos made half of the universe vaporize, including numerous superheroes. This highly-anticipated follow-up (and conclusion to 22 films) is not the typical action-packed adventure. It takes 2 hours (yes, it's 3 hours long) before the big battle begins and it's nothing special in terms of staging, design or effects. For the first 2 hours, the group of leftover Avengers works to figure how to right the last film's devastating destruction. If you're invested in this universe, their conflicts and quests are interesting (with a lighter sprinkling of humor than usual). If not, you'll be scratching your heads trying to piece it all together. Otherwise, it's more a conclusion (with a few inevitable farewells) than an exciting addition to the genre.",-1
Where have I been all this time?! This may be the best movie that I have ever seen!!!,1
"While it's a definite improvement over its snoozy predecessor, this latest installment in the franchise gets some things right but misses the mark on others. It's refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't place an overreliance on special effects and action sequences, choosing (wisely) to take a more human and personal approach to telling its story. It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid). Die-hard fans will no doubt love this, but, to the less initiated, this is likely to come across as a somewhat half-baked effort.",-1

"While the plot and script isn't as smooth as ""Infinity War"", ""Endgame"" is an immensely satisfying culmination of the previous 22 MCU films that delivers plenty of impactful moments.",0
"While there are some very confusing moments with the time travel rules, the film is very solid and a satisfying conclusion to the first three phases of the MCU. Honestly, the climax where all the heroes come together is worth the price of admission alone.",0
"While this is a good Marvel movie in its own right, there are serious flaws in the execution of the story. The first half of the movie was fine. However, once they introduced time travel as a prime-moving plot point, they really screwed up the story. They didn't even follow their own rules of time travel. The heroes' actions completely nullify the events of Infinity War. It causes the viewer to wonder why Infinity war was a movie in the first place.",0
"While this movie brought me to tears a few times, it was ruined with just a few shots for me at least. Just take the shot where all the women save spiderman. Why? How? When? Where? That was so horrible, it deserved at least two points down for the movie. Another two points down for that Captain Marvel saves everyone moment. Like, really? I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",-1
"Whiny, boring and way too long. Captain marvel was forced into this movie to be a glorified intergalactic uber for two seconds. hulk goes into a teleporter with dr Phil and can now smash and do your taxes at the same time. Infinity stones used to cause instant death, but can now be held by anyone. Its gross that a movie this bad will inevitably be one of the most profitable movies of all time. The professional reviewers should be ashamed to give such a mediocre movie glowing reviews.",-1
"Whoa, just wow, what a movie. In 3 hours of plot, character, incredible action, mind blowing CGI and real emotional scenes, Avengers: Endgame does not cease to stride above the rest of the MCU. A film that brings viewers back in time and allows the viewers to think about how much the MCU has given us. Very contemplative storytelling is blended with great humour and mythic battle sequences to create Endgame! After (I think) Infinity War failed at managing film with lots of characters, Endgame does not.The characters each are represented with a realistic perspective. Their weaknesses are shown to the viewers. And finally the stars are allowed to act. Hollywood’s most famous actors step it up in Endgame and deliver heartfelt emotional scenes and moments without anything tying them down. The best part for me was how Endgame felt like reading a comic book, the action, the plot, the characters. Even some sequences felt like they were drawn by Stan Lee. But as with any film Endgame has problems but minor problems. First, Thanos could have been defeated much quicker. Some characters were glazed over and forgotten about. Finally, the Avengers could have made better choices. There were ways, easy ways, they could have accomplished their tasks. Some of the things they did were stupid. All of these are minor problems. Avengers: Endgame is by far my favourite Avengers film.",1
Why is this a 7.8. This movie was amazing it really made me feel something at certain points and concluded the 1st story-line very well. I clapped really hard and I cried really hard.,1
"With all the hype surrounding this film before its release, it was hard not to have high expectations once it finally went out.I myself am one of those people. Fortunately, it did pretty well and didn't disappoint. To me, it would've been better if all their time traveling somehow created ripple effects in the present to make it more realistic but I guess you can only fit so much content in a film.",1
women going to war are funny part scene.  and ironman dying is the best part. thanks u.,-1
Worst avenger movie out there. Dont waste your time. Everything about this movie is terrible excluding capt using thors hammer,-1
"Worst Avengers movie ever - Capt Marvel does nothing. Why the hype to release her origin story two months before? Seriously, build up a sequence of 21 films for this terrible end movie????",-1
Worst Marvel movie ...............................................................................,-1
"Worst marvel movie, why did you make this? Why did I even watch this crap...",-1
"Would rather watch paint dry for 6 hours, than to waste 3 hours on thisEnding was boring and we all could have seen it from the beginning, the movie could have been 1:40 minutes and we would still have everything important.",-1
"Wow , first time to stay 3 hours long in the cinema . It's quite an experience in IMAX with laser . Movie is alright , just like what i expected . But 50 USD worth ticket per one is insane !",1
Wow what a great idea  movie!!!!!,1
"Wow, what a bloated disappointing mess of a finale. At 3 hours this is a boring and tedious film with phony drama and several humour miss-fires. A fat Thor gag is absurdly over done and sums up how tired and cynical this toy commercial is. Worst of all, the end is a re-run of the last film and I could only recommend this failure to the under 12's. If you liked Transformers, you'll like this.",-1
Writing left much to be desired. They really milked the nostalgia. Predictable plot,-1
"Yeah, I hoped for a good film, but this was nowhere near one…As it stands the first part of this duology is a much stronger film. So Infinity War > Endgame. By a huge margin, I would add…SPOILERS AHEADEndgame was rather disappointing and slow, the pacing was awful, and it just sort of fizzed out by the end of it, not even the death of Iron-Man felt special. His previous fight with Thanos on Titan felt more impactful. And that’s just it… The film rang hollow as a whole. It just did not flow as easily as Infinity War, and was lost in its time travel shenanigans… Spider-Mans and Peppers goodbyes felt like ticks on squares. Its like the rollercoaster ride was a flat line that didn’t take the highs to where they should have soared and as a result it meandered through long stretches of melancholy emotions and dialogues, many of which could have been cut shorter. They lost on film, on action, to honour characters, parents, loss, grief, friendship... I get that, but it’s a lot and too much at times, so they lost the dynamics of film in the process. The films story-telling suffered. Its depressive opening tone was soon undercut by its trademark one-liners and quips, and it soon felt like the whole film was straying in a strange direction where the filmmakers couldn’t decide which way to go and how they wanted to paint the film as it were. The way they went with many of its characters and their moments felt like they were not holding up or were just jarring. Some of these are…What have they done to Thor? It feels like they ran out of creativity so they lazily shat on his character and made him a **** and a loser. Also, Thor somehow beats Thanos with a fully gemmed glove with Stormbreaker, but can’t do so with Mjolnir and Stormbreaker against Thanos without any gems? Where is the consistency? Also, if he takes Mjolnir from another timeline than what does Thor fight with in that timeline, in the Dark World and Ragnarok?What have they done to Hulk?  We don’t get any action from the Big Green. Its especially disappointing after he was held back in Infinity War. So there is no payoff for Hulk? Really? They fumbled his character where he should have unleashed the monster and overcome his fear of Thanos. Big mistake character wise. They left him unused. One-armed and weak. Shame, it still feels like such a huge and glaring missed opportunity.Also, the whole soulstone bit with Widow and Hawkeye just feels like a cheap gimmick after the drama with Thanos and Gamora in the previous film. Hawkeye is mourning the love of his life, his family, so the Russos make him ultimately sacrifice himself for a collegue from office? Cause that’s how their relationship always felt. Isn’t getting the soulstone about the ultimate sacrifice one makes? Why didn’t Banner go with Natasha? It would have made more sense soulstone story wise? Hell, Cap had more chemistry with the Black Widow than Hawkeye… Odd choices.There are many other missteps (a friggin rat?), but in conclusion: Nothing remarkable happens for the first two hours (for an action spectacle film, spectacular action is nowhere to be seen) and the third act or hour feels overstuffed and incomprehensible, with dialogues and action all over the place. Where Infinity War was good at balancing characters, acts and plotlines, Endgame is nowhere near as coherent. The last act feels like too much of everything, and very little of it is quality. Honestly, Endgame does not FEEL like a magical blockbuster experience after you exit the theatre, nor does it deserve a higher grade than a 5/10.",-1
"Yes the movie is that good. For any Marvel universe fan this is a must-see movie as it is the last one and arguably the best one. It's a pity that some of the heroes die, which means we definitely won't see them again. The ending is very beatiful.",1
"Yes, it is, by definition, imperfect, because it is made by and for humanity. Avengers, ASSEMBLE!",1
"You got to be kidding me. You call that the best conclusion for all the marvel films since Iron Man. That was the most boring movie ever. Come on, time travel. That was the stupidest climax of this Movie. If you want to make this movie great about time travel then you got to be logical which place and time to be than other random time and place to receive something important. If they want to go timeTravel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones  when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future. That would have make much easier instead going to different timelines to get the stones individually and Black Widow could have been alive. The first half was so boring to do timeHeist. So overall, let’s pretend this movie never happen and use my own creation for this movie without time travel and continue with the other future marvel movies. I’m was pissed of on this movie.",-1
"You sit there waiting for it to start well after the movie begins, shaking your head in disbelief as this unbelievably thin, abominably bad bloated bore ticks on and on!  The same creatives have delivered the same padded plodding overlong junk one entry after another.Once upon a time, superhero movies were made by adults for wide general audiences.  Now they're made by childish nerds for the dumb illiterate global masses who eat up whatever **** Hollywood shovels out!  Marvel, once dramatically clever and incredibly inventive, now puts out uneven unfunny goofy geek comedies.It used to be serious actors balked at comic book fare.  Now they can't take it seriously enough.  The annoying cast in this ridiculous over-the-top series never question the utter lack of narrative talent of its writers, directors and producers, but instead dutifully drone on yucking it up on talk shows and all the way to the bank.  Where's the oversight?!  Disney/Marvel and the rest don't care or know how to make good movies anymore.  They're bean counters on an auto pilot conveyor belt.  There's no restraint whatsoever regarding plausibility.  As absurd as the original grouping of superheroes is (but fun and true to the source, not invalid), they go and pile on every Marvel property including large groupings not even part of The Avengers into a smorgasbord of so many freaking characters slapped together in an endless stupid stream of one liners as excuse for story the result is incoherent plotting (despite its infantile simplicity) and really no emotional investment in any of the characters at all.However big the inflation/population driven box office, this is some very underwhelming STUPID ****",-1
"You've seen it, you know its perfect. Best Marvel movie to date and an amazing conclusion to the Infinity saga.",1
