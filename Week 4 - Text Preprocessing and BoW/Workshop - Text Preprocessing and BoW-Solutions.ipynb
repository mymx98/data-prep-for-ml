    "## Case Study Background\n",
    "Following up from our previous work, \n",
    "after extracting relevant text information from the `review` and `address` columns, \n",
    "it's time to \"grade\" whether a review is positive or negative. \n",
    "This is called \"sentiment analysis\", and it's a widely studied problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). \n",
    "To do this, we need to pre-process our text-based reviews, \n",
    "and transform them into a vector representation. \n",
    "Note that we won't be building the sentiment analyser, \n",
    "but will only practice the steps leading up to it. \n",
    "However, we do have a bonus for you at the end of this spreadsheet to have a taste of how sentiment analysis works!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Understand the process and usage of various text preprocessing techniques: tokenisation, casefolding, noise & stopwords removal\n",
    "- Understand the differences between stemming and lemmatisation\n",
    "- Be aware of the waterfall effects of various choices in the preprocessing pipeline\n",
    "- Understand the idea of vector representation, sparse matrix, and Bag-of-Words\n",
    "- Know how to implement these preprocessing and vectorization steps using the `sklearn` and `nltk` libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop Overview\n",
    "- Apply preprocessing steps to a single review parapgraph\n",
    "- Compare the differences in 2 alternative preprocessing pipelines at each step\n",
    "- Compare the differences in 2"

      "Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.\n"

    "1. Normally, we simply need to use `.lower()` to perform casefolding, but Python also has a specific string method called `.casefold()`. What are the differences between these 2 methods, and in which situations do we need to use `.casefold()` over `.lower()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Notice how the lemmatizer didn't fully return the root word of some words, like \"putting\", \"watered\", and \"cheapened\"? It's because the function wasn't called with the proper \"Part-Of-Speech\". Check out the difference by running the below code:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    print(lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"putting\")) # By default, WordNet infers this word as a Noun\n",
    "    print(lemmatizer.lemmatize(\"putting\", pos=\"v\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `pos` parameter, we force it to treat putting as a verb. Auto-detecting the part-of-speech of a word is actually another big NLP problem. The following site will give you more insights into how this is done: https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html. If you want a challenge, you can try to implement a lemmatizer that is enhanced with an auto part-of-speech tagging to increase the usefulness of the lemmatization (this is beyond the scope of the tutorial and subject, but a very satisfying problem to work on!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. An alternative vector representation for text data is TF-IDF (covered in the lecture). The `TfidfVectorizer` function works similarly to `CountVectorizer`. Have a look through its documentation here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html and produce a TF-IDF representation for the preprocessed corpus."
