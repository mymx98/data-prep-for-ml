review,address
"Avengers: Endgame is dumb. Very dumb. It's a messy, convoluted time-caper strung together by cheesy one-liners, lowbrow actions, and halfwitted takes on morals, ethics, and the value we place on life. I understand that one doesn't go into a Marvel flick expecting high art, but the mass public fascination towards these characters and the esteem critics hold this film in would suggest otherwise. More to the point, I think that when you have this large of an audience, mainly of impressionable teens who are forming complex worldviews, you have a responsibility to give people something real to chew on.The actors clearly had a good time working on this picture and their acting charisma really is a force to be reckoned with. That much I'll give the movie credit for.",39 Aaron Place Norwood VIC 5091
What an unbelievable accomplishment to have shaped the previous 21 movies and end it here in the most beautiful perfect way possible. Endgame is the be all and end all of MCU movies.,461 Achernar Close Bondi Junction VIC 5125
"Disclosure: I'm NOT a Marvel superfan, but I've seen all the movies, starting with Iron Man (actually, starting with Howard the Duck), and I was starting to get tired of these. However, this is a really good movie. A little bloated at 3 hours, yes, and it takes almost a full hour to really kick into gear, but they writers/director do an excellent job wrapping things up.  Some truly touching moments, and some extremely funny moments.  (""Hello Jeff Lebowsky!"") I though Capt. Marvel was given a short shrift, but I suppose that makes sense given her late entry in the series in general.  Clearly, we're not going to be seeing certain character(s) after this film, but I think it's deftly handled for maximum emotional payoff.  In my theater, there were belly laughs, cheers, and ugly cries.  Can't expect much more than that in a big budget flick, huh?",24 Adair Street Bundaberg VIC 2127
"""Avengers: Endgame"" is about memories, nostalgia and tons of fan-service moments. This is a movie that understands its audience and fans, trying to give each character's story closure without forgetting to provide valuable entertainment for the whole crowd. It also might be a tad too cheesy for some people's taste, particularly when there's a comedic relief scene.My biggest concern coming into this movie was the insertion of bland and uninspired jokes that plagued my overall solid experience in ""Infinity War"". This film was an improvement in that regard but it isn't without its cringe-inducing moments. Things like the ""Fortnite"" scene (and more than that I won't say) just made me roll my eyes. It's unbelievable how they manage to overkill it with these comedic scenes that are so painfully unnecessary and do nothing to advance the plot. I understand that you're trying to make your audience have a good time and all, but this is just unbearable.Other than that, the comedy - I thought - worked just nicely for the most part. The jokes that existed didn't ruin the tension.The characters were very central in this movie. Some characters shined; others not so much. I didn't like ""Captain Marvel"" and I certainly don't like the titular character, so I was grateful that she was underused in this movie. Everytime she's on screen and she smiles at the camera, it feels as though the actress is trying to show charisma, but there's none whatsoever. Not that the actress is awful - it's simply that she is not as interesting as the writers are portraying her to be. I know some critics enjoyed Chris Hemsworth's performance and the character, but it's sad to see that the character is reduced to a comedic relief (again).The movie also boasts an impressive budget, with so many set-pieces and computer-generated effects to be observed. This element of the movie provided the writers with so many angles to explore the story. While ""Avengers: Endgame"" is three hours long, the narrative is entertaining enough to overcome the more stale sequences. The movie never feels dull and it keeps you in the edge of your seat. I had a fun time watching it.7/10.",51 Academy Close Floreat VIC 2680
"It feels and watches like a seasin finale of a series. You don't expect it to be good. You expect certain thing to happen. They happen. And it's not good. This picture is about 4 of the avengers. The rest is not important and non-existent. Tip for Disney: when you hype different, fake plots to keep the real one secret, try to make this real one better then the fakes...",12 Abercorn Crescent Joondalup NSW 3055
"They got so many things right... then turned around and got so many things wrong.If I had to guess there were many disagreements about how to go about this movie and it shows in the writing/pacing.Im sure this movie will go down in the record books both in money made and ratings, but there are so many movies in the MCU that are better written and better executed.Ill watch it again once it comes out on dvd and see if a second viewing changes my opinion.",4 Abernethy Street Greenwith NSW 2745
"Everyone needs to stop freaking out about the 3 hour runtime. The movie isn't even 3 hours, it's the credits that gets it there. Seriously. Anyway, this is easily the best Marvel movie to date and I don't know how it could ever be topped. Any negative review is just ignorant and shows bad taste. A fantastic ""end"" to a truly fantastic saga, and an astounding beginning to whatever they give us next. Bravo, Marvel.I dedicate this review to Stan Lee, the man with one of the biggest legacies that will ever exist, and just an amazing human being.",64 Adkinson Close Belmont VIC 4306
What a movie! Well worth the wait. I can't wait to see it again. It was hard not to let the tears flow with such an epic climax to 21 movies. I loved everything about it and was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen.,30 Abercrombie Circuit Hazelbrook  5571
"Endgame was a frustrating film for me to review, Because on one hand I was mindblown by the sheer force of this film. While, it is a satisfying conclusion to the stories of Iron-Man, Captain America and a few others; you can't help but get confused by the convoluted and overthought time-heist middle of the film. It's not as good as Infinity Wars it still provides a ton of emotionally satisfying moments that should please longtime fans of the series.",21 Adcock Place Poowong North VIC 4055
Avengers: Endgame is the most satisfying conclusion possible to 11 years of built anticipation. The movie contains a fantastic balance between classic Marvel humor while making the entire audience aware of the stakes and the gravity of the situation. References to previous MCU entries are constant and emotional moments are present throughout. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.,87 A'beckett Street Strathalbyn NSW 5073
"I see the trolls are already coming out for this film as well, its a damn shame. The film is fantastic, an unparalleled feat of blockbuster filmmaking. The breathtaking action and scale of the last act is amazing to be sure, but it's the first two acts, where delicate character moments, an irreplicable balance of ingenuity and wit, and emotion extracted without veering to the melodramatic (a fine line that only a script and direction as superb as this can walk without teetering) where the film really stands apart. For those who have followed the franchise from the beginning, this is the finale we deserved and then some. Bravo, bravo",9 Adkinson Close Seaton VIC 2790
"While it's a definite improvement over its snoozy predecessor, this latest installment in the franchise gets some things right but misses the mark on others. It's refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't place an overreliance on special effects and action sequences, choosing (wisely) to take a more human and personal approach to telling its story. It also deftly incorporates humor that actually works and in just the right amounts at just the right times. Where it fails, though, it comes up supremely disappointing, such as lazily drawing upon time-worn plot devices that show a lack of imagination, a closing sequence that goes on far too long, giving short shrift to a number of key characters and employing a screenplay that all too often assumes viewer awareness of material from previous installments in this and related franchises (a real problem if one hasn't seen all the movies in question, something that many other cinematic franchises have successfully managed to avoid). Die-hard fans will no doubt love this, but, to the less initiated, this is likely to come across as a somewhat half-baked effort.",12 Adamson Crescent Werribee South  6151
"Avengers: Endgame is a triumphant and emotional closure of the MCU's Infinity saga, an epic series of 22 movies starting with 2008's Iron Man. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo have done a tremendous job in managing so many dozens of characters and making a great movie.Let me start with the bad news. Endgame isn't as impactful as Infinity War, because the 1st movie's Snap that erased countless living beings is about to be undone. Another reason for this is Thanos. In the 1st movie he was a perfectly balanced and well-written villain with a human side. In the latest movie he's been reduced to another blood-thirsty criminal, no different than Ronan the Accuser or Red Skull. I expected to see some more character development and backstory for Thanos, but there was none of that. Still Thanos proves to be more than a match for the heroes in combat, much more so than in Infinity War.Apart from Thanos, everything else in this movie is almost perfect. This is the culmination of 10 years and 21 MCU movies' worth of storytelling. The stakes are so high that nearly every MCU character joins the fight against Thanos' armies. I even expected to see the Kree, the Skrulls, and other cosmic beings such as Dormammu or the Celestials (it has happened in the comics) join the fight against Thanos as well because he's the biggest threat to the Universe, but I guess it would have been too much to ask for. The final battle is as chaotic as those of the Lord of the Rings or other epic blockbuster movies, with a satisfying ending nonetheless.But Endgame is not just fierce battles and non-stop violence. There is plenty of personal drama and tragedies happening, too. Characters confront their past and make amends with it. Others have to grief and keep going. But there is also tons of comedy and fun stuff, as you'd expect from an MCU movie. I could go on and on but I'd spoil things. The myriads of past comic book story references are impressive and touching.Kudos to the many actors involved. Everyone did their best job in this genre-defining movie.But most importantly, the audience in the cinema hall cheered, screamed, ""oooh""-ed and cried multiple times during the film's many important scenes. Particularly during the late Stan Lee's seemingly last ever cameo. That sense of community and ""we are in it together"" kind of feeling is not something usually found in other movies.Avengers: Endgame isn't the end for the MCU though. It's like the season finale of a TV series before the next one is broadcast later on. It's an episode where things calm down after the climax and story threads are wrapped up before the next adventure begins. The MCU will continue, but Marvel have yet to reveal their plans for the future. For now, there is the Spider-Man: Far From Home movie to wait for.",44 Adkinson Close Padstow VIC 2527
A more than worthy closure.AVENGERS ENDGAME is excellent in all aspects.Everything is well balanced.I love the Scarlet Witch.THIS CINEMATOGRAPHIC EVENT IS SO GREAT that there are no words to describe it.,8 Adamson Crescent Bullsbrook TAS 2484
I'm interested in this amazing blockbuster movie from MCU.In the end of the line this is a good endgame for marvel...,29 Abercorn Crescent Parramatta VIC 3435
"It's a good conclusion to a 21 movie saga.  It's not perfect, a little longer than it needs to be, but it's a very enjoyable film.  A trip down memory lane of 10 years of marvel movies.",41 Abercrombie Circuit Old Reynella  2250
"What a way to conclude the first chapter such a thrilling movie. The acting was really good I really just want to watch this movie over and over again,",23 Adamson Crescent Greensborough VIC 5127
"I was somewhat disappointed with Endgame. Following on from the epic that was Infinity war; which coupled action sequences with emotive dramatic scenes, the time-travel arcs in Endgame were peppered with too much slapstick-esque comedy and a lot of unnecessary fan service scenes.",90 Adamson Crescent Caulfield WA 3148
"This serves as the conclusion to the entire Marvel universe Infinity Stones saga. Not that there aren't going to be anymore movies. Disney likes making money. But with several main actors' contracts being up and bowing out, this will be the end for several of the original Avengers team. What results is something we've never quite see in a film: a season finale, the culmination of a franchise of multiple movies, characters, and story arcs. (The sheer logistics involved making this must've been insane.) And I had the hell of a time with it all!The one big issue about Avengers: Infinity War, the first installment of this film two-parter, is that it had to juggle so many characters, that there wasn't a lot of time for characterization. However, now the cast is narrowed down to mostly the original Avengers. Brought back is the characterization that made so many of the previous films. Here we find the heroes at their lowest and trying to right things. What proceeds is a great character piece We see the conclusion to some of stories of people we've gotten to know after all these years. The finale is the most I've ever been emotionally influenced by a film.Although this is an ensemble piece, Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark/Iron Man is the big lead, the hero that started the whole universe off and all his scenes, his highs and low, are great.Thanos is in less of this, but the cool, collected planner still makes a great villain.Fans of the movie also get to see callbacks to so many plot points and surprise character appearances. (Although, some things might fly over your head if you can't remember or haven't had the time or inclination to watch everything.) In fact, be prepared for many surprises in general.There is some pretty serious subject matter here, especially the first act. However the script manages to nicely balance this with humor. Both Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Paul Rudd as Ant-Man have some great delivery and lines.The movie looks great. (Again, the ability to make Thanos' facial expressions look so realistic is amazing.) Although, I wished some scenes were lit a little brighter. You can't always make everything out. The final fight scene is amazing and may be considered one of the all time greats.Admittedly, the movie doesn't have quite the tension of Infinity Wars. The second act is interesting, but not as strong as the beginning or end.Considering the hype of Captain Marvel being in this, she really isn't used much. Karen Gillan does a great job as Nebula and she appears more than in any of her other films, but I kind of still wanted to see more interaction between her the and the other cast mates. A majority of characters from previous films are in this, but if you wanted to find out whatever happened to Lady Sif or Sharon Carter be prepared to be disappointed. I'm really surprised about Sharon, considering that the directors who forged her character did this movie, too.Overall, this movie was an event that will make you feel all the feels, and I recommend you see this before it's spoiled.P.S. Don't worry about sticking through the credits. No end final scene this time. (They really wanted to set this up as a final chapter.) Thought there is a slight something if you're a movie completionist.",6 Academy Close Labrador VIC 3025
"a word, BRILLIANT!THIS IS THE BEST MCU MOVIE SO FAR AND THAT'S THAT. I will miss this....",9 A'beckett Street St Albans  6169
"Not bad, good, but Infinity War far better. The Endgame is hm... Is too half-hearted and calculable.",3 A'beckett Street Hawthorn QLD 2340
"This is a tricky one to write when many people have still not seen the film, so no worries if you are reading this, there will be no spoilers. Look for the spoilers on The 602 Club podcast next Tuesday. If you listen to my podcasts or have read this blog, you know I am not afraid to be critical of Marvel movies when I feel it is warranted. Case in point, I felt like Infinity War was, “… a mixed bag that has the effect of one being served a gourmet burger and then only being given a minute to eat it. There is so much happening, yet there’s so little pay off, leaving the audience unfulfilled, wanting a better movie and resolution. We all know the conclusion is coming in 2019, so now that the compulsory is over, we wait and wait and wait.” It was frustrating to feel this way, specifically since I just didn’t feel much about the movie, other than ambivalence and this left me trepidatious for Endgame.So with that preamble, I know you are are all waiting eagerly for my thoughts on the end of the Infinity Stone Saga…. it is satisfying. That’s really what we want after this twenty-one film, eleven year investment, right? We want to be satisfied emotionally and thankfully Endgame is everything Infinity War was not in that department. The movie will capture you from start to finish. Personally I am happy with where my favorite characters are at the end and that is enough.With the three hour run time and the contrivances to overcome Thanos, there are some issues. The movie does feel a bit long, but it also plays out better than Infinity War. Where that movie left you feeling unable to focus because there were so many characters and not a moments rest, Endgame is able to take its time. This may be it’s greatest strength, that you don’t feel rushed, you’re allowed the opportunity to care about what’s happening because you’re not being whiplashed between stories every other minute. For my book, Endgame is the poignantly satisfying conclusion to this part of the Marvel saga I wanted. It is not the perfect movie but it’s the one we deserve. Endgame is rate 4 out of 5 Cap Shields.",16 Abercrombie Circuit Kilcoy VIC 3109
"Amazing movie, a fantastic conclusion to a saga that lasts 11 years. Not perfect in the complex, but of great impact and really exciting",1496 Adamson Crescent Malvern East VIC 6167
"Way, way, waaaaaay, way, way too long. Nothing else is even worth mentioning because it's 3 times longer than it should be.",29 Abercorn Crescent Cookernup QLD 850
"Whiny, boring and way too long. Captain marvel was forced into this movie to be a glorified intergalactic uber for two seconds. hulk goes into a teleporter with dr Phil and can now smash and do your taxes at the same time. Infinity stones used to cause instant death, but can now be held by anyone. Its gross that a movie this bad will inevitably be one of the most profitable movies of all time. The professional reviewers should be ashamed to give such a mediocre movie glowing reviews.",34 Achernar Close Enoggera NSW 4270
"I don't get the hype behind the movie. All that happened was that they went back in time and stolen the infinity stones before Thanos got them. Then thanos gets wind of it and travels to their time. Then a big fight happens where there's tons of booms and such. Everyone was playing 'keep away' with the stones. Some people were put on a mantle *coughmostlythefemalescough* while a few people died on screen. Then one hero uses the stones to 'snap' away all of thanos's troops, this guy dies and everyone gets sad over it. There's some narration by the dead dude and all other heroes continue on their day to day activities. That was the whole movie sum'ed up and honestly? This whole movie just felt really cliche'd and average at best. I wasn't that invested in anything and I actually grown bored with all the drama and sob stories that was constantly occurring. The action scenes were too flashy and just all over the place and while there was some unexplained plotholes in the film and even a large amount of dangling threads, I honestly think they're just planning on explaining those things in a future film or something. Regardless, not worth seeing unless you are heavily invested in the Marvel franchise you might like the movie but as for me, a person not invested heavily in the Marvel Franchise?  I thought it was just and average cliched film at best.",253 Ada Place Kirrawee NT 2580
"The movie left a bad taste unfortunately.- Wamen power was pushed obviously in one ""in your face"" scene and of course in every scene captain marvel is in, it was distasteful- Captain Marvel being pushed into the movie with some reshoots is damn so obvious, you can clearly tell her scenes feel very off- Nothing explained about the infinity stones, no conclusion to why what happenned. No answers to what happened to Titan, no answers to the mistery in the wisdom of the stones- First half of movie is very emotional and satisfying- Robert Downey Jr's best acting in his carreer was in this movie- Why did Loki die? What did he mean by ""you'll never be a god"" or ""sun will shine upon us once more""? No answers. And he seems to be permanently dead.- Thor is the most wasted character in the movie. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him an alcoholic Zakk Wylde with broken character riddled by insecurities playing Fortnite! He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in the end he gave away what he already had as well, but what of his vision in Age of Ultron? What of his wisdom that pushed him off to go searching for infinity stones?- Movie feels to be changed dramatically after a sudden change of mind and if there is multiple cuts / alternatives for this movie this is not the best one among them, for the depth, immersion, feeling of a structure do not exist in this movie. All the characters and events are miles wide, inch deep.- This Thanos is not the same great antagonist we saw in the IW. He is shallow, insensitive, as a matter of fact, shallower than Ultron.- Action scenes are too chaotic, the fight sequences that focus on characters we saw in IW do not exist in this one. Just too much blend CG.When I came out the theater I asked myself: ""Are these the same guys who made the Infinity War?""",29 Abercrombie Circuit Colonel Light Gardens NSW 4053
"This movie has 4 mentionable issues, two small and two big, but overall it's a fun, entertaining, exciting, surprising at times, and emotional. Small issue #1. The Captain America Vs. Captain America fight could have easily been prevented by future Cap saying something only Cap would know. There's a better way to do that scene. Fight first then future Cap states only something Cap would know, ending the fight. Small issue #2: Pacing of the first act. At 3 hours, the movie mostly moves at a nice pace, but there was a bit of lag at the end of the first act. Big (and biggest) issue #1: Thanos finds out about the plan because past Nebula is on the same ""network"" as future Nebula?!?!? Future Nebula would know that might be a risk and/or would tell that they were reading her memories when she got to the past. That's really lazy writing and it the main plot point of brining Thanos into the fight.  A better way to do that is have either future Nebula infiltrate Thanos and get caught or Thanos intercepts the future Avenergs messages and is concerned enough to investigate and ends up catpuring future Nebula. Big issue #2: The ending with Cap on the bench and Bucky and Falcon watching him. In this scene, if there's one person who's going to approach Cap it's Bucky or both of them, but not Flacon. I mean they even made a whole movie about Bucky, not Falcon. Secondly, if Bucky would have went over there, would Cap have given HIM the shield or told Bucky to send Falcon over? (I'm cool with Falcon being Cap BTW). That's just for starters. The team throughout the movie were trying to prevent messing up the timeline by changing events, but Cap does just that. He goes back and marries Peggy preventing her from marrying her original husband and having her original kids (from Cap: TFA). This is a huge time ripple. In short, because there's so much awesome, funny, and exciting moments, it raises up an structurally 6/10 film to an 8.",21 Abercorn Crescent Ermington QLD 2088
"It's in my opinion the worst marvel movie I've seen and I've seen all except for the captian marvel movie. I loved the previous avengers movie, which I rated 9 out of 10. I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time.We need better ending to all these years of loyalty. So many things in this movie are unreasonable. This movie needs to be snapped out of existence...",15 Abbott Street Frankston NSW 3135
First of all the story is really boring. There are many scenes where u fallasleep. Also ironman and nebula rescue part is so weird and too fast and not explained well like they were in a hurry to make a short scene that they have been saved by Cpt Marvel. Really badly designed scene. Also no view about the civillians how they feel about their lost friends or families. Nothing we get only view from the avengers and only Earth. Another thing is that where Scott comes out from the quantum realm becuz this scene so fast and really not explained in any way. I know its a 3 hours long movie but sometimes if u cut the boring parts and replace with important part them everything will be okay. So the time travelling is a thing in many movies to fix a movie becuz the directors stupid to make a good movie. Now they split up to 3 groups to get the stones from the past but the biggest joke is they didnt try to get all from one time like before thanos snap. Thanos against thor surprise is really strong becuz he can kill Thanos. Why not travel back cut his arm and take the stones go back and thats all. But they choose the worst part to get the stones from the wrpng and complicated way. Also Thanos wasnt that great villain and the story badly explained about him the comics were way mich better than this idea. They used the bad time travel idea to kill Romanov. Also they use the stones in the end to kill tony stark. When Captain Marvel get the stones and able to snap and kill the villain but not she has a too stupid character. Also this movie killed 3 main characters to give it to the next generation and Captain Marvel character was so bad before and she will ruin the MCU and the others not enough good. Sorry Marvel thats not enough to be worthy like the comics. We got some villains and needed to kill 3 characters read the comics and checkout how many villains are there. Many acting were so bad sometimes they are forced ina scene to be there but totally not exist there., Adair Street Wandin North NSW 3954
"They said it would never happen. They said it would never be accomplished. But WOW,they’ve done it. I finally had a movie where the Italian Audience reacted to it like an American Audience,and it was glorious. Truly unforgettable. Anywho,the review.Yeah,it’s good. What did you expect? This big culmination of 10 Years worth of 300+ Movies to suck? You must love Jurassic World 2,then.All jokes aside,Avengers Endgame is a beautiful movie that somehow still puts the entire population in the world (Infinity War being just an anticipation of that) as main leads,and still make it a time at the theater full of poetry. Poetry that,for a Marvel movie,is still surrounded by sheer “MCU Formula” stupidity. Not as a whole,though.For a story that lasts 3h2’,this manages to go by pretty fast,like a 50 Minute TV Show Finale,even for one that deals with the casualties that Infinity War had,and just like final franchise movies,they mention almost the entire MCU,right down to the first Iron Man movie being an instrument for the story. The story goes by just like you thought it would go,and much more. Yes,there’s Time Travel (I’m allowed to say it,because other critics mentioned it),yes,there’s the traditional Marvel Formula (even if it lasts for,like,15 minutes in this hulking bowl of Seriousness) and it has a pretty easy structure to follow,which is surprising,considering that 3000 Characters and Time Travel in a Franchise movie are the recipe for a Box Office Flop. Several times they either repeat the same ole’ moment from *Insert MCU Movie name here* or they hint at that. Come to think of it,the structure of the story goes just like how Tony Stark has a great idea and it goes south real fast (remember Age Of Ultron? Good times…).The score by Alan Silvestri is alongside Thor Ragnarok and Black Panther at being the best MCU Score. At parts,it’s reminiscent of Forrest Gump (with the gratuitous melodramatic Violin or a piece mostly composed with Violins like the Theme or “They’re Sending Me To Vietnam”),and like every Final Movie in a Franchise,there are pieces from IW that are repeated in here (“Undying Fidelity”,”Even For You”,there’s a few...).If it has a shot at it (and unless another movie blows me away with that),this better have a Best VFX nom at the Oscars. So many pretty things (and CGI) to talk about in here that I can’t because it’s “Oh So Spoilery!”.But not everything is flawless,as this movie has some flaws that pissed me off A LOT. The First Act of the movie is enjoyable,but there are 2 jokes where they try to modernize it,to the point to where I’ve never thought a Marvel Movie could beat Ferdinand for a Dab joke (and you know I despise those things SO GODDAMN MUCH),and every minute of its runtime is pure Fan Wish Fulfillment,with a big,loud,bombastic 3rd Act that’ll make Nerds real happy. Just let me watch a movie,I don’t need a quote from a comic every 3 Seconds!Thanos got downgraded from the biggest threat of the MCU to “still threatening,but kind of an imbecile”. They try to make him as hateable as someone like Drago Bloodvist (from the How To Train Your Dragon series),but it ends up being a traditional ethic villain that threatens (I MEAN IT) to destroy the entire Galaxy with everything he has (a snap is not enough,huh?),with one decision in general that kinda made me angry,but still hope it’ll improve upon rewatch.Also,if you’re planning on an IMAX watch,see it in 2D,not in 3D. I almost had a headache for 3 hours of 3D Superhero Brawling.  But,aside from the jokes,what is there to really complain about? Just for too much Comedy and brutal decisions,I can see someone hating it a-la Last Jedi. SO MANY RISKS TAKEN IN HERE AND I LOVED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.But still,I had a great time,you’ll have a blast,your family and friends will,and everyone else will enjoy this epic conclusion in a Franchise that,ironically,half the world grew to love as time went by. This ain’t no Spider-Verse,but it’s the best thing the MCU could offer. Besides,I finally got to see an Audience bursting to tears (one girl holding them),so that’s a Big Plus for me. :-D",24 Abrahams Crescent St Clair VIC 2265
It kinda feels like they phoned it in this time around along with Captain Marvel being an objectively **** **** hero due to her powers. I dont know it just didnt feel right in the slightest in comparison to infinity war.,75 Adamson Crescent Casino  2756
"This was the funniest Marvel movie yet.  Lots of funny one-liners which makes this an enjoyable film.  It is too long at 3 hrs and the first 30 min drags, but it picks up and gets you invested.  It does get predictable at times and is the quintessential Hollywood blockbuster.  I was surprised how plot heavy this installment was (not much action until the second half).  Overall, a fine conclusion to the Avengers story line and worth a watch.",27 Abbott Street Bridgeman Downs VIC 4018
"If you look at the past of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; 11 years, 22 films, all leading up to Avengers: Endgame, one can definitely make the argument that this is one of the most ambitious films in human history. As someone who loves all sorts of movies, I do not make this statement lightly. To keep this as concise and spoiler-free as possible, this movie subverted my expectations in major ways, and I was not disappointed. I was grinning like a fool through the entire three hour runtime. There are some minor hiccups, but honestly, so much is tied up so nicely in this film, and Endgame will be a gold standard that epics measure themselves for years to come.",4 A'beckett Street Ashwood VIC 2101
This movie was okay. I am in love with thor because hes super awesome and sexy and captain america sucks i hate him hes so annoying. I was very disappointed with this movie because thor was fat and not sexy for almost the entire movie he barely fought. I almost cried when that idiot captain america was able to pick up thors hammer but i was even more mad when his eyes turned blue and he could do the lightning thing. Thor is way more awesome than captain america and in avengers end game it didnt seem like it. It was more of a comedy than an action and adventure movie. The ending was sad because my third favourite avenger iron man died I rly rly rly wish that it was captain america instead. But anyways thor is just super awesome and it would have been fine if he was fat for a bit then he was sexy and awesome again at the end for the fight scene but no he was fat and not awesome the entire time. I was super excited to see thor be all awesome and his eyes turn blue and lightning strikes everywhere like when he came into wakanda in infinity war but nooooo he was fat and not sexy. And also i didnt like captain marvels haircut and the first 2 hours of the movie suck and i wish that they at least made all the superheros awesome for the end. But instead they made everyone but the strongest avenger (thor) awesome. And i also like black panther and he was in it for like two seconds and i love tom holland and he was cute in it but he was only in it for like two seconds. So pretty much thor rules captain america drools but for some reason they made thor fat and not awesome at fighting and not sexy the whole movie so im very upset but obviously i still love thor with all my heart chris hemsworth is the sexiest man alive,47 Abercorn Crescent Beecroft SA 4020
"Way too many plot holes and inconsistencies to be a great movie. I have always been a Marvel fan , but this is unreasonable. The time conundrum's not withstanding , I feel , the Hulk and Thor were both pushed aside. Capt. Marvel is way too OP and Capt America wielding the Hammer better than Thor? Tony Stark wielding the Gauntlet that the Hulk couldn't take? Convenience is not a good excuse for poor storytelling. Don't even consider the time element. Nothing more than a money grab by Disney and Marvel. Sadly , the fans will flock and they will feel justified. The most important part of any movie is the story. It seems harder and harder to find a cogent and entertaining movie nowadays. Hundreds of millions of dollars and this is the story they come up with? Again , a fan of Marvel since childhood , I feel betrayed. As a child , I mowed lawns so I could buy my favorite Marvel comics. Hated DC and still not really receptive to their stories or characters. I felt the same way with The Last Jedi. So maybe it's a Disney thing. In summation , this movie is truly disappointing for me. A lifelong Marvel fan , maybe it's time to watch something else.",67 Achernar Close Leichhardt NSW 6210
"This is the biggest fail I ever seen. I loved precedent chapters, I really wonder how they could change an awesome heroic adventure into a poor comedy with no action (6 minutes of fight on 3 hours? Less?) I can't imagine how Hulk's or Thor's fans are thinking about it... I'm really disappointed on this closure.",38 Abbott Street Lakemba  6062
"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.",33 Adamson Crescent Carlingford VIC 7171
"Yeah, I hoped for a good film, but this was nowhere near one…As it stands the first part of this duology is a much stronger film. So Infinity War > Endgame. By a huge margin, I would add…SPOILERS AHEADEndgame was rather disappointing and slow, the pacing was awful, and it just sort of fizzed out by the end of it, not even the death of Iron-Man felt special. His previous fight with Thanos on Titan felt more impactful. And that’s just it… The film rang hollow as a whole. It just did not flow as easily as Infinity War, and was lost in its time travel shenanigans… Spider-Mans and Peppers goodbyes felt like ticks on squares. Its like the rollercoaster ride was a flat line that didn’t take the highs to where they should have soared and as a result it meandered through long stretches of melancholy emotions and dialogues, many of which could have been cut shorter. They lost on film, on action, to honour characters, parents, loss, grief, friendship... I get that, but it’s a lot and too much at times, so they lost the dynamics of film in the process. The films story-telling suffered. Its depressive opening tone was soon undercut by its trademark one-liners and quips, and it soon felt like the whole film was straying in a strange direction where the filmmakers couldn’t decide which way to go and how they wanted to paint the film as it were. The way they went with many of its characters and their moments felt like they were not holding up or were just jarring. Some of these are…What have they done to Thor? It feels like they ran out of creativity so they lazily shat on his character and made him a **** and a loser. Also, Thor somehow beats Thanos with a fully gemmed glove with Stormbreaker, but can’t do so with Mjolnir and Stormbreaker against Thanos without any gems? Where is the consistency? Also, if he takes Mjolnir from another timeline than what does Thor fight with in that timeline, in the Dark World and Ragnarok?What have they done to Hulk?  We don’t get any action from the Big Green. Its especially disappointing after he was held back in Infinity War. So there is no payoff for Hulk? Really? They fumbled his character where he should have unleashed the monster and overcome his fear of Thanos. Big mistake character wise. They left him unused. One-armed and weak. Shame, it still feels like such a huge and glaring missed opportunity.Also, the whole soulstone bit with Widow and Hawkeye just feels like a cheap gimmick after the drama with Thanos and Gamora in the previous film. Hawkeye is mourning the love of his life, his family, so the Russos make him ultimately sacrifice himself for a collegue from office? Cause that’s how their relationship always felt. Isn’t getting the soulstone about the ultimate sacrifice one makes? Why didn’t Banner go with Natasha? It would have made more sense soulstone story wise? Hell, Cap had more chemistry with the Black Widow than Hawkeye… Odd choices.There are many other missteps (a friggin rat?), but in conclusion: Nothing remarkable happens for the first two hours (for an action spectacle film, spectacular action is nowhere to be seen) and the third act or hour feels overstuffed and incomprehensible, with dialogues and action all over the place. Where Infinity War was good at balancing characters, acts and plotlines, Endgame is nowhere near as coherent. The last act feels like too much of everything, and very little of it is quality. Honestly, Endgame does not FEEL like a magical blockbuster experience after you exit the theatre, nor does it deserve a higher grade than a 5/10.",60 Abercorn Crescent Whittington NSW 3181
"As a conclusion to so many movies Avengers Endgame hits hard with the nostalgia, really good fan service, epic fight scenes, a good story which is not non-stop action and heartfelt ending. My main problem with the movie was sometimes the humor which for the most part lands but sometimes does not and can be out of place in certain situations. Some nitpicks can be said about some technical or scientifical things but this is a movie with a walking, talking, sentient tree and racoon  so those are minor issues for me. This movie has minor flaws but still the good parts of this movie outweigh the bad parts by a mile.",80 Adcock Place Corlette VIC 5062
"This isn't a bad movie, but it wasn't what I expected. There were so many sponsors which were shown in the movie undiscriminately (AXE, audi and Fortnite) except for the PS4 one. There was too much humour and there was a clear social and politic message which looked really obvious in the movie. The strongest avengers such as Hulk and Thor lose the uniqueness of their power in the movie and they are ridiculized while Captain Marvel is stupidly overpowered. The movie has too many stupid jokes and unnecessary scenes. The plot isn't very interesting and it should be more close to the comics. There are still many more mistakes to talk about but it could spoil some scenes. I'm giving it a 7 because of the special effects and the sound/music (even if it is too repetitive during the movie), also because it wasn't as disappointing as Captain Marvel. The actual score should be between 5-7.PD: What the hell is the last scene with Captain America and the way Thor looks?",96 Adair Street Wilston VIC 2752
"This is a classic case of being overwhelmed by hype and desperation for a good piece of writing that our subjective views can outweigh the objective truth of the film. Initially, I wanted to give this film an 8 or 9, but now I am thinking 6 or 7 are more appropriate after multiple viewings.Robert Downey Jr. by himself, is one of the main reasons to watch this movie, he is at the top of his game, his character arc is meaningful and impactful, and all of his interactions in the movie are heartfelt and excellently delivered, especially when it comes to conversations with Captain America, Peter Parker, and his own father.This film also boasts a hefty amount of fan service by bringing all of our favourite heroes together for one last time and it was a treat to watch. All the usual character interactions, funny dialogue, and nicely-timed one liners are present and land properly, with minor exceptions, and this movie certainly does make for a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was.Unfortunately, this film also became littered with plot conveniences, inconsistencies, and holes, the moment it decided to introduce time travel. This is always an incredibly tricky plot device that many movies struggle to implement properly, and this film is no exception. Time travel will always open up a million scenarios of ""Why didn't they do this, at this point, to achieve this?"", and it ultimately hurts the storyline as a result.Some characters also seemed to get worse in this instalment. The Hulk, is now a weird human hulk hybrid who is competent with his science (not enough for time travelling), able to control his temper, and is busy dabbing in cafés. Thor is now an overweight, disheveled shell of his previous self, who spends his time drinking and injecting awful Fortnite and online gaming references that won't age well. Thanos is more of angsty teen with emotional issues, rather than the intellectual and maniacal prophet he was in Infinity War, which was one of my favourite MCU characters. Captain Marvel is back and causes more damage in her 15 minutes of screen time than any superhero ever, big sigh on that one.The big battle was a bit too short for my liking, especially considering the buildup and hype it received from its previous instalments, but was still ultimately entertaining and fun to watch. Also have to mention that outside of Tony Stark, Rocket & Nebula were my favourite performers in this film. Rocket, for the comedy, and Nebula for the internal conflict and character arc. I thought most characters were either average, below average, awful, or did not receive enough screen time to evaluate.+ Robert Downey Jr. and his stellar performance+ Rocket & Nebula were great characters+ Excellent special effects+ Emotional character interactions and payoffs+ Some well timed humorous moments+ Worth the theatre ticket price+ Gratuitous fan service- Slow start and awkward pacing- Plot inconsistencies, holes, and conveniences- Over abundance of poorly timed humour moments- Awkward cultural references- Some characters are awful in this- Minor political injections- Captain MarvelOverall, this is a case of the Russo brothers having to do so much within a certain time frame, like closing all the character arcs, and it may have ultimately suffered because of this. Objectively: 5/10, Subjectively: 9/10, Overall: 7/10.",50 Abercorn Crescent Yass VIC 6148
"I'm disappointed. The script is poor. A few characters are absurdly marginalized, others were forced into the plot. There are clear inconsistencies. The ending is rushed.", Acraman Place Blacktown WA 2121
"The time has come. The thrilling conclusion to the Infinity Stones saga and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it. After the shocking cliffhanger in last year’s, “Infinity War”, the long year wait moved fast and slow all at the same time. Now that we are here, the questions began to flow in. Who lives? Who dies? What happens to the world? All of these questions and more are answered but not in the way you might think or in the most understandable way. The film opens up with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) free-floating in space on the Guardians spacecraft with Nebula (Karen Gillian) after the snap from Thanos (Josh Brolin) and losing Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), and Drax (Batista) on Thanos home planet, Titan. Some humor is added to the mix with both Tony and Nebula playing a game of paper football while waiting for life support to fail. This leads to a monologue with Tony recording a message to Pepper (Gywneth Paltrow) through his helmet. After that, it looks like he is close to death. But, a orange glow overtakes the ship and it’s Captain Marvel (Brie Larson)  to the rescue. From there, they are reunited with the team that remains. Fast forward a bit and now they find Thanos, thanks to Nebula. The stones have been destroyed and Thor beheads him. What do our heroes do? Five years later and still no results. The movie petals along for a good solid hour with our heroes trying to find different theories until they realize that time travel is the only option. The first hour of this film does tend to move a bit slower then you traditional Marvel film. We are treated to a very depressing and somber tone with giving each character their moment and what they have been doing over the last five years. The biggest moment by-far is given to Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Beer and time have not been kind to him. Yes that’s what I said, beer. I don’t want to give it away but his appearance generated some of the theater’s funniest laughs. I was glad in this sequence to see a few characters from “Thor: Ragnorak” make a return appearance and see that they are alright. I was really surprised how many laughs were in this film considering where the story is at this time. I think there may have been almost too much funny going on here at times but that may have been just because of the audience that was with me in the theater. Petaling along, we are treated to all of the avengers splitting off into different times to locate all of the stones before Thanos gets them. These were some great sequences and it was great to see some old familiar people from past Marvel films and callbacks to the first avengers film. Time travel is a key part for the whole last two hours of this film and while things to make sense at times, there are also many different plot holes I found too. Some time travel events don’t exactly match up with previous time rules we have seen in other films or what common sense would tell you in these situations. It leads to some convoluted and messy things that still are a bit bothersome especially when five years have passed and at the end of the film, Peter Parker goes back to high school and sees his friend,  Ned (Jacob Batalon). How did high school resume for them when five years have passed? I am hoping this is answered in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home”. The final battle of this film is quite the epic spectacle. Not as big as some of the reviews were hinting because I still believe in the big picture of things that the battles in the previous film were a bit better. Although the moment where all of the avengers assemble here is quite the goosebumps moment. The CGI is nearly flawless in the film with only some moments in the final battle looking a little too green screen. There are a couple of deaths in the film. One of them I was expecting and another not so much. I won’t tell you here but the one I was expecting gets a proper sendoff and it is a good farewell that feels right. I am also pleased that Captain America gets the ending that I always wanted. It’s exactly what I predicted and if you listen to mine and Jason Kobasic’s podcast on the previous film and our first part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe recap, you will know what I mean. This film bookends just about every thread from the previous 21 Marvel films. It couldn’t have been an easy task for the filmmakers to put that together and create something special. They did and everything comes together real nice in the final moments and I loved the final shot. It  put a smile on my face and felt very satisfied. I still like “Infinity War” a tad bit better then this one but this is still a great addition and an epic conclusion to these first three phases. Bravo Marvel and we will see you in Phase four and beyond. Grade: B+",18 A'beckett Street Mullumbimby VIC 3620
"A good ending for Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. Those 3 Battling Thanos at the same time was the best thing in the movie. Hulk was hilarious, i wish he got to fight Thanos too. Hawk Eye were finally used properly. But there was alot more bad than good in this movie. The Female Avengers Movie setup felt so forced no ones excited for that. Pepper Pots as Iron Man again? it didnt work in Iron Man 3 and it dam sure is not going to work in future movies. Captain Marvel, shes is just the worst..too OP to care about her future movies. Judging by the direction they are going, i see that this is the last Marvel Movie i will ever need to see. Its been fun.",8 Adkinson Close Hawthorn VIC 6102

"A very mixed bag of good ,bad and meh. They actually could have split this episode into 2 parts and it would have been better because they tried to jam way too much exposition,wrapping up of loose ends and results for all characters into 'only' 3 hours.That didn't leave any time for most characters to be anything more than devices to move the plot along.The last hour makes the price of admission worth it though as a lot happens.Anyone worried about Captain Marvel taking over the film as dominant figure rest easy .It's not that way. Still worth an 8.",13 Adair Street Coldstream VIC 5452
"This one is a bit weird to judge.As a person who read alot of comics when I was younger, and have seen all the movies at least once, I was invested in the characters wich helped alot. Its alot of pretty good acting, but unless youve watched the earlier movies you wont understand alot of whats going on, and probably wont care. But for me? + : Good acting, good action and a fitting celebration to the last 10 years of movies.- : Not alot (from my POV)Neutral: the plot was a bit ... I dont want to say bloated, but a bit all over the place in the middle. And it was a LONG movie, for good and for worse.",27 Adinda Street Blackheath QLD 4109

"Best Marvel film, so emotional, electrifying, so much heartthrob, and definitely worth the three hours",13 Adinda Street Scarborough NSW 3002
It is unfortunately but not unexpected that they would drop the ball at the end. There are simply too many characters and the story is quite boring and messed up.,231 Adinda Street Bittern QLD 2652
"Don't be fooled by all the one-review account 10-scores, there was probably some sort of prize to be won if they gave this movie a 10. The truth is that the first hour of this movie is plain boring, I mean really boring. After half an hour it becomes clear that time travel is the way to go to set things right. Can you say major plot holes on the way? Presposterous plot followed by an hour of messy crap before they get into any kind of action. The ""comedy"" is sort of on par with Infinity War. More slapstick for those who enjoy that kind of thing. Chuckles here and there and thankfully not as awkwardly childish as Ragnarok.The war scenes were good, I mean really good. Thanos is nicely done again and the fights are really well done, as we've come to expect really even if deja-vu creeps into the picture more than once. A whole lot of things still don't make any sort of sense. Captain Marvel was pushed in there with twice the charisma compared to the movie with her name on it, but that's not really that big of an achievement. Not that those good scenes are an excuse to have to sit through three hours of movie. They could have easily taken off half an hour to an hour and simply have created a better experience. It's really just too long for what it's bringing to the table.Some characters retire and some die, that's something in the sense of closure for the MCU and things to come. It could have been worse I suppose but boredom was the real winner in the end. I was really glad to get out the theatre and that's not a good sign at all.Still it's not all bad, just slow, dumb and messy before they get to the sorta good stuff. The good stuff is really good, there's just not enough of it to go around.",6 Adair Street Highett VIC 3167
"I rate it a 7 but it is an absolute must see. Endgame has almost impossibly high expectations following Infinity War which I consider a 10. Endgame is more of an homage to the MCU with one of arguably the best battle scenes in movie history. My only complaints are Hulk has become more of a joke than one of the most powerful characters and Captain Marvel, after not even being on Marvels fans radars a year ago, easily overpowers everyone else. The will have to come up with a new level of villain to even challenge her. But the film is more dedicated to the original Avengers and gives them the honor they deserve. Great movie!",14 Aaron Place Lue VIC 2196
"I really want to like this movie. But sadly I don't. And even sadder...probably many feel the same. Talk about a collective cacophony of underdeveloped, rushed and even forced plots. I usually judge a film on how much I would want to see it again. On a scale of 1-10 for second viewing, I'd rate this a 2. It just wasn't that enjoyable or interesting. The end result was very predictable and took very few chances-if any, unlike the last film. To have Caps die as an old coward (choosing his gf over the lives he could've saved/impacted) and Iron Man dying a hero made me really conflicted. This film just really feels patronizing and insulting in a 3rd Matrix, Lost Finale/Seinfeld Finale kind of way. And it makes me VERY concerned for Star Wars Ep.9. The 3 hour length isn't what sours the experience. It's how much frivolity and sloppiness that plagues those 3 hours. Its ultimately very forgettable. Even the choppy slapped together editing seems to have lost interest half way through. Its a shame as I feel this was a dead end that Infinity Gauntlet created. There was no successful way out of that rabbits hole...And while Captain Marvel wasn't as integral as many fans feared, she still felt forced into the plot/film and actually served as a major disruption to the flow more than anything. I walked away from this film felling very ""meh"".",5 A'beckett Street Eastern Heights VIC 4570
"It is clearly a movie aimed for fan service . It takes the old guard and say goodbye . Any loyal fan who sat for 20+ movies get rewarded as we are bombarded to references from other movies  and Easter eggs. It almost requires an extended cut of 4/5 hours as there is barely anytime for character development. You actually wonder what was the fuss with Capt Marvel . She is way over powered compared to the rest of the heroes . You really can't relate to her . It feels like a DC character that was just slingshot  into the MCU .She is just a blunt weapon and I still don t understand her power. She is as attractive  as the hammer she plays. How does she navigate space , found the lost in space heroes at the beginning , where was she for 5 years (??), how do they contact her when they need her and how long she takes to travel. The main issue with managing so many stories , so many characters and so many time line is plot holes.....And there is so many it is mind blowing .There is enough spoiler online so i won t drag but the quantum realm affecting Janet Pym but not Scott Lang the same way , killing your old self and still standing ?, disappearing for 5 years and going back to your life like nothing happened and no one aged ( that may be addressed on the next movie tho), consistency with previous movies while time jumping etc.... I guess the movie stay with you long after you finish watching it '",38 Adinda Street Whyalla VIC 3842
"After being such an avid fan of these (mostly) marvellous films for so long, it's such a shame to have it ended this way.  It still entertained (mostly) but i think that hinged entirely on the fact that i've liked these characters in other movies - and by the time of the very hastily put together 'final battle' which i thought was filled with CGI near-misses - i'd checked out.",167 A'beckett Street Neika NSW 2408
"Overall great movie hampered by a very slow start (3 hours really not necessary here), a lack of consistency (fans of thor wont be too happy), comedy that falls short and what feels forced into the overall quite serious story and some fairly distracting politics pushing. Captain Marvel was an unwanted intruder into the story of familiar characters and quite often I sighed out loud at the blatant attempts to garner the attention of the media or get awards. Entertainment should be entertainment and whether I agree or disagree with the politics, I would rather they refrain from using a fun action superhero movie as a political platform.The ending alone however is a fitting conclusion to the marvel story and unforgettable though to actually enjoy the film properly you will have needed to have kept up with the majority of the MCU which is one hell of a task and will probably leave you a bit tired of the superhero genre. To improve on this movie they would need to have fixed the pacing at the start of the movie, yes its building up to the conclusion but so has every marvel movie, you don't need 2 hours to explain things.They would get rid of the politics pushing. Captain Marvel should not have suddenly popped up to brag about how strong she was, felt empty and insulting to the original heroes. Also forcing all the female characters to be in one scene for a snapshot for the media might sound like a good idea but one doesnt actually fight and one was meant to be fixing something so it felt distractingly pushed.They also should not have messed with Thor as much as they did and they should not have messed around with the 'strength' of all the heroes. This universe is too old to suddenly add a hero a few weeks before the conclusion of it all who dwarfs the rest of them in strength (Captain marvel)...",2 Adkinson Close Wynnum West VIC 4051
"First spoiler alert, Iron man dies, black widow dies and Captain avenger retires, Thor puts on weight. (In the beginning of Movie he kills Thanos the inevitable who has lost all the stones and leaving alone in a planet after the destruction now the movie is all about going back to how it was before Thanos)Movie starts with stony stark being in space, then Captain Marvel comes all the way rescues him.Total movie is based on time travel and setting everything back in place, ant man is the guy who gives the plan of time travel where they go back and collect all the stones and defeat Thanos the inevitable.Movie has lot of curse words and sentences from all the superheros. Humour is always seen with Hulk and Thor, not to miss Iron man and Spider man here.So it is technically all the heros go to the past, get the stones and changes everything in present but while they have gone to past to get stones, Thanos comes in with them from the past to the present. Even though they change everything Thanos is also back from past to present and the end war happens, so at the end Iron Man kills Thor by snapping his finger using 5 stones and he dies.Black widow gives her life for soul stone, Captain America retires and goes back to his past finds his love.Overall I think Captain Marvel is the strongest hotest and sexiest super hero",26 Aaron Place Granville VIC 2170
"The first movie was WAY better.  Just wanted to get that off my chest from the start. There was to much sarcasm, jokes, and general nonsense throughout the movie.  While the first film had you on the edge of your seat, this movie seems to do everything it can to take the nervous anticipation completely out of the film.  The middle of the movie REALLY dragged on.  My wife was actually glad she needed to use the bathroom so she'd have an excuse to step away.  My wife and I are big comic book hero fans, and actually collect comic books together, but we were off and on board throughout the middle 1.5 hrs of the film.  They have this ONE chance to turn everything around to bring back those they loved, but every 5-10 minutes, the cast are making light of their situation.  It just really ruined the immersion, and tension that SHOULD have been surrounding their perilous journey.  Captain Marvel/Brie Larson felt SO out of place in the film.  They literally threw her into every scene she was in, but it didn't feel as if she should be there.  There was no emotional connection to her at all even though she basically saved the Avengers.  The way the final battle went down up to the conclusion seemed rushed after having sat their for 2hr 45 min with little to no action.  After the final battle, the reminiscing sequence afterward lasted forever, and we were ready to leave once the battle concluded, but there's like 20 more minutes afterward that didn't feel needed.  Lastly, Ill only say that the sequence towards the end with Captain America passing on the reigns to another character was one of the biggest liberal pandering segments I have ever seen in a movie, and left a REAL bad taste in my mouth at the end.  Why can't films leave politics OUT.  So tired of it.  Anyway, I wanted to give the film a better score, but it simply doesn't deserve it.  We actually thought we'd go see this a few times like we did with Infinity War, but we have no interest in sitting through another minute of this movie until maybe its released on video.",51 Adair Street Mansfield VIC 4178
"slightly disappointing end to the avengers saga. It only kept you on the edge but never got you to jump. personally i felt it lacked action scenes for example, hulk never got to fight thanos and captain marvel came towards the end only. yes i understand there was going to be certain number of dialogue to be made to complete the story but still, as an ending and a 3 hour movie i felt the content should have been more. the movie focused too much on the feels and not so much on the works. in the end its a decent ending but still felt it could have been pushed more.7.5-8/10",1 Adair Street St Kilda VIC 3044

"This is over a decade in the making and delivers on most of the things I thought they'd touch on in this movie. While there are some inconsistencies in the plot but to say what those are would be to spoil it so I'll refrain from doing so here. The plot clearly doesn't want you to think too hard about some of the stuff happening but it does handle the subject matter very well. The length is a bit of a turn off, even though I'd be hard pressed to figure out what they could have cut from this movie. And the ending is very well done and moves the MCU into a new chapter. I'll be very interested in seeing where they go from here, especially since GotG 3, which was billed as the start of the next phase of movies, is going through such turmoil. But for fans of the MCU this is a no brainer and easily worth the lengthy run time.",6 Adair Street Glendonbrook VIC 4104
"best marvel movie to date!!!!can't say much with spoiling so I will keep it short. I was absolutely stunned by the movie. Last year I thought infinity war would be my favorite mcu movie but it ended up taking the number 3 spot. This time I thought I should wait until declaring it the best in a long series of amazing movies, but halfway through the movie I said there's no way by the end of the movie It's not my favorite marvel movie.Marvel went balls to the walls, throwing everything they had creatively and successfully doing so. the amount of good fan service was unbelievable, and compared to such a complicated plot they stuck the landing. most importantly the movie has a lot of heart, finishing a 22 movies, 11 years in the making, epic storyline, with a lot of feelings and emotions.

"I promised never to go on Marvel movies after awful Age of Ultron, and other movies were pretty average to say at least. But sometimes, like in case of Civil War and Infinity War they were pretty good. So I expected from Endgame the same - that it will be a ""good"" Marvel movie. But oh my god... It was just horrible. I will not include spoilers here, but I will say one thing - writers should abandon idea to include time travels in the movies. It doesn't solve anything, but creates just enormous plot holes. Nuff said. 3/10, just for visual.",18 Acraman Place Cedar Vale  6017
"Don't let that 8 scare you, Avengers: Endgame is by far the most ambitious film of all time and a very important film as no other films cannot create such a big franchise.Endgame is funny, depressing, satisfying and very enjoyable and everyone gave their all (for one) in this film as some actor/actress will probably never return for the MCU after this film. There were a lot of easter eggs from this movie which links to the other films in this universal which was awesome to hear especially at the end. Everyone has a good reason why they make these decisions and doesn't leave the viewer confused. Overall, the action scenes were satisfying and awesome, the ending was a great conclusion to this movie and just in general, this was (almost) the perfect marvel movie and it's definitely worth your 3 hours of lifeThe reason I said almost is because of these reasons:1. Captain Marvel was barely in the movie, they made an entire movie about her and yet you didn't really need to watch it for Endgame as she's rarely in it and she was in the climax of the movie. Plus Brie Larson was horrible in this film and I know that she is a fantastic actress which disappoints me even further2. The movie is funny. Maybe too funny. There are so many emotional scenes in this film but then they quack a few jokes in there which sure they're funny but it destroys the flow of some tear-jerker moments3. Speaking of the flow, when they finish a dark, miserable scene, they immediately go to a bright, happy scene which just confuses me. Why could they just slowly tune down the darker scene and slowly build up into a relatively happy scene?    However, with all the negatives, I will probably rewatch this movie again",5 Absolon Place Innaloo VIC 6018
"This movie brought me to tears; several times. When a movie cultivates that much emotion in someone, I declare it as an incredible work of art (or amazing marketing). It never ceased to entertain me and it interested me until the end. The only thing that keeps me from saying that this is the greatest movie I have ever seen, or at least of the 21st Century, is that one must watch all of the 20+ movies beforehand in order to fully feel for the characters and be encompassed by the beauty of what the MCU has come to be. All in all, I would suggest this film to anyone, Marvel fan, movie fan, or bum (because that is the only other thing you can be if you are not the other two).",25 Adinda Street Eungai Creek VIC 2750
most overrated film of 2019.This film is to boring why all the new super hero films has same scenario?,43 Acacia Garden Beeliar NSW 4030
"I loved infinity wars, and seen/liked nearly all of the other movies in the series. Unfortunately Endgame falls short in quite a few areas. I certainly don't mind a long movie, but that comes with the assumption that something is happening in that time. There was some good, but mostly a lot wrong with the movie which I'll break down.Pro:-For the most part the final fight scene is well done and visually exciting.-Tony Stark scene is sad, but ultimately a fitting end to his character arc.-Quite a few jokes, though perhaps this is unfitting for what is supposed to be an action film.Cons:- Captain Marvel completely ruins the pace and tone of the movie. Every scene she is in leaves you rolling your eyes. This Mary Sue character is so much stronger than every other character and avenger that while their entire team is trying to save one planet, she is off  saving ""thousands"" (in her words). Her story, and character is unconvincing, and she is so incredibly powerful that she upstages every other person in the movie. She destroys Thanos's battlecruiser (A ship the size of a small city) by literally flying through it with her fist. But not before being blasted by its cannons (And shrugging it off totally unaffected). The same cannons that had just annihilated the entire avengers compound into literal rubble. She then proceeds to eliminate half an army before fighting Thanos who has all infinity stones. Earlier Thor, Captain America, and Iron man all fight Thanos without the stones, and are beaten. Yet Thanos with the gauntlet is no match for her as she shrugs off a blow from him and laughs about it. I was worried by every scene with her leading up to this point that she was going to swoop down and single handedly save the day, which would completely invalidate the ""teamwork"" tone of the rest of the movie. I wouldn't be surprised if it was originally written that way but changed last minute.- Iron man and Nebula are floating out in space, and who comes in to save the day? Yes you guessed it. The incredible Captain Marvel. Super being who is able to fly through space unprotected (No need for oxygen) at apparently faster than light speeds, and has the omnipotent knowledge of exactly where these two were floating at somewhere in space. Tony Stark is supposed to be a super genius, and he has the help of an android. Yet they couldn't work together to create some solution to save themselves? No. Instead super being swoops in on a literal golden beam of light to save the day. Disappointing, emasculating and anti-climactic.- The time travel plot was pretty disappointing, and left a lot of loopholes. Such as thors hammer not being returned, and how changes in the past wouldn't affect the present. How they would be sent to an alternate universe. Well then I must point out that the original universe that thanos half destroyed would still persist, and upon returning the heroes would be sent to another universe which they would then change. It opens up so many holes in the story I don't have enough room to go on. Why time travel? 10 years of writing, millions of dollars, and they resort to that cliche? Very disappointing.- Thanos is ambushed and killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. Really? Everyone going into the movie is expecting a secondary power to counter his, or a long build up and occasional conflicts with thanos or something of the sort. Instead he dies without a fight, the movie has no villain, and instead they spend 2 hours making jokes and playing up overly dramatic scenes.- Thanos himself was ruined as a character. He was the ultimate villain in the previous movie, but in this one he barely seen any screen time. He had no character development, and ultimately after a trivial struggle with every other avenger, he was brought down by Captain Super Being and her sidekick Scarlet Jedi.  Leaving him distracted just enough to let Tony Stark snatch the stones away under his nose.- Thor was ruined. Really sad what they did to him. He had so much passion and such a great story arc in and leading up to Infinity War. Then they turned him into a fat drunken clown. Literally making booze jokes through nearly every scene, being called fat jokes, and generally being worthless and unheroic. - Dr.Strange, perhaps one of my favorite avengers did nothing the whole movie but hold back a wave of water for a few minutes. - No post credits scene. Every single other movie had a final scene at the end of the credits, but not the final movie? Not even a joke reference? A dozen people stayed in the theatre I was in and were all audibly disappointed.Overall the movie was enjoyable through parts. But I feel like Disney is going to ruin the future marvel movies. I think Captain Marvel is a good indicator of what is coming ahead. Unrelatable super heroes with unbelievable powers flying through space and saving thousands of planets at a time. Honestly...What villain can even compete?",3 Adamson Crescent Frankston NSW 2156
"I absolutely hated this movie, i thought it was boring, poorly written and inconsistent...-Time travel and the way it is used in this movie absolutely sucks, it's so convenient and almost without negative repercussions to the main time line..-Thor and Hulk are a joke in this movie.(Thor is too weak even with two hammers and the Odinforce and is fat, drinks alcohol and plays Fortnite and Hulk is basically Ruffalo with CGI and doesn't participate in any action scenes)-Captain Marvel and the way she is portrayed in this film is horrible, she just comes and one shots Thanos's entire army while Thor with 2 hammers and the Odinforce can't do anything.-in a movie with time travel elements in which they just resurrected the entire marvel universe how can Tony Stark die?can't they just go back in time and get him? (we have Gamora from the PAST living in the PRESENT now!!!)i get it that the actor's contract is ending but still..-Thor abandons his people and leaves with the Guardians???wow that was laughable, they are probably planning for a New Asgard series so probably because Hemsworth can't participate they just had to put him out of the picture like this?-Falcon is the new Captain America?why???isn't he just a regular guy..why not Bucky for example?-all female superhero moment...the amount of cringe!!!-the tone of the movie is like this...pointless drama with bad jokes-the last battle is pretty impressive but doesn't last for long and captain marvel totally ruins it...-they should have used the marvel cosmic beings and give this battle much bigger scale, after all thanos affected the entire universe not only earth.-Nebula kills her past self while being in the present and SURVIVES??!?!?!?-Pepper Pots is able to pilot the iron man armor like a pro, better than War Machine.-Dr. Strange does absolutely nothing in this movie, he just collect all the heroes off screen and opens some portals in the end, oh and he uses an aoe spell for half a second. These are only some of the flaws with this movie..Of course it will make a lot of money but it's mostly due to the hype and Disney's promotion which is essentially the best in the market...",2 Abernethy Street Baxter  2640
"Characters:Pushed an agenda with Brie LarsonCaptain Marvel ruins the only good scenes in the movie and also could have easily shortened it by a whole hour. The Hulk/ Bruce Banner's character arc was absent from the film. There is nothing of the Hulks character arc except that Bruce Banner got at peace with the Hulk and now is professor Hulk for some reason.Thor 's character was completely butchered. In the beginning of the movie he was silent, then suddenly has a random outburst and kills Thanos, afterwards in the future becomes a fat drunker that plays Fortnite all day. Not to mention that he stays this way for the rest of the film. This happening to the Thor, such a well built up character (besides Thor Dark World) is very disappointing to see. Especially since Thor was built up in Ragnorock and very crucial in Infinity War. His character ending up like this and the audience knowing he is stuck like this forever is very saddening. Loki, Heimdall, and the dead asguardians don't feel avenged.Iron man in space was major waste of time since the audience know his dragged out death scene on the Malano is for nothing. The audience know Iron man isn't going to die in space so having him sleep there like he is, is just a huge waste of time. To make this worse, instead of having Tony Stark and Nebula. A character is who is also stranded in space with him come up with a great plan to fix the ship so that they can get back to Earth. All they do is have the Mary Sue, Captain Marvel. Come out of nowhere, save them, and carry their ship back safely to Earth. This shows the viewer that there is only an agenda of feminism being shoved at them to love Captain Marvel. Tony Stark, who is one of the smartest characters in the MCU get saved like this. Whether it may have been a man or a woman makes no sense. There was no reason for him to be in space if he was just going to get rescued.Thanos, which was remarkably the best MCU villain to date was COMPLETELY ruined by bad writing. Since the first Avengers back in 2012 we get to see hints to Thanos and how powerful he is. Him sending the Chitari to New York, killing billions of people across the Universe, stealing Nebula from her parents, wanting all the stones for power, ect. In this movie when he was introduced everyone was hoping for the mad titan to be ready for them and have an epic battle but no. All we got was him getting ambushed, not prepared, and getting decapitated in once slice. This made the audience feel sorry for a Thanos. A being of immeasurable power and strength instead of feared. Now instead of the Avengers who easily killed Thanos, having a villain to fight. It left the audience thinking of only two options.  Having another villain to fight or going back in time fight a younger Thanos but still kill him easily since this one died with one attack.In the end fight scene when Captain Marvel comes in from who knows where. She end up pulling a Kirby from Brawl flying straight through Thanos' ship blowing up the whole thing, killing his army, and almost killing him. Of course Thanos' on the spot thinks of using the power stone to punch Captain Marvel away. They could never have Captain Marvel kill him because all the fans would riot after the movie especially since they Disney knows nobody likes her.Tone:The movies tone was all over the place. At times it would get sad and then suddenly hit you with a really bad joke(out of place comedy).Since the movie started off with a very sad tone once they started adding in comedy it took away the dramatic effect of the eventsThe movie was set up to be a dark film but had many ridiculous jokes and was very all over the placeOthers:Not a good finale for an 11 year build up and 45+ hours worth of filmsTime travel doesn't make much sense. Supposedly whatever is done in the past is its own universe and even if they change events in the past nothing changes in the future. Captain Marvel getting attacked by Thanos without the power stone and not taking any damage or flinching confirmed that she is a Mary Sue. Hulk getting the same amount of burns as Iron man make no sense.Thor is nerved to much even with both hammers.Even thought Banner is professor Hulk he never actually fights.Thor leaves his people for the Gaurdians of the Galaxy because reasons?Female super hero moment feminism is extremely obvious and very awkward.Doctor Strange is wasted and does nothing but transport everyone to the battlefield.Much longer than it needed to be.",14 Adinda Street Flemington VIC 3854
It is a ten year build with ten years of plot holes that pile up. The most notably happen when a lot of Age of Ultron plot points are forgotten and characters lose abilities and information for Thanos to be a threat. The humor in this movie is too overpowering considering the situation. How they did Thor and Hulk dirty was a major turn off. This movie didn't live up to the hype. The last 30 minute is good but then you are left with mainly plotholes in that fight as everyone waits their turn while dispatching easy killable villains and disappearing air support that ignores enemy ships for Captain Marvel. The whole run the gauntlet is stupid considering they have an army of teleporting sorcerers who can also just teleport Thanos to pieces or just drop him into the upper atmosphere. Hulk doesn't redeem himself from his lacklust performance in Infinity War.,65 Acacia Place Bossley Park QLD 5540
"Avengers: Endgame is everything that Infinity War was not. It lacks a defined, meaningful, or interesting story, fails to explore new facets of any of its characters, and has a total disregard for all of the material that came before it. There's an old adage in comic books that any story that is solved with time travel is no story at all, and for Endgame this holds true.",53 Adair Street Salisbury VIC 4343
"Speaking of Gomorrah, seeing her again was great, but they wasted it. TBH, Nebula was great and the stark contrast in the progression of her character, from her interactions with Tony at the very beginning to her and Gomorrah on Thanos’s ship, was really compelling. However, Gomorrah really disappointed me. She has so much depth and tension in her character and they explored it really well in Infinity War, when Quill tried to kill her, and in Guardians of the Galaxy, but in this one, she changed her mind about her father REAL quick and OFF SCREEN and was really a throwaway character despite the fact that her death was one of the true deaths of infinity war and one of the most beautifully tragic moments for Thanos and humanized him. If they aren’t going to bring her back and give her a real touching moment, then just give her an Easter egg like with Loki and Thor, which was a great moment and really hit the nostalgia. Which brings me to the biggest plot confusion of the movie, which I was thinking about the entire time - isn’t it really hard for a human to hold an infinity stone? They made a huge **** deal about it in Guardians of the Galaxy, and they talked mad **** about how powerful they were, and yet all 13 of the **** were tossing them around like nothing?Furthermore, giving the Hulk the first snap is a **** disgrace, but I’m biased because I hate the Hulk. Bruce and the Hulk combined, great for him, is an obvious culmination of the entire Hulk storyline as a final resolution to his constant warring over the two halves of him, but he’s not a compelling character, he has no depth and he’s pretty **** useless in battle, but he got the snap and survived because he’s super strong!!!! At that point in the movie I was thinking that the director’s were just like “let’s just give them all something so we can end this **** series and move the **** on”. On an aesthetic note, one thing that I thought was so great about Thor Ragnorak and Infinity War were the great, artistic, and cinematic moments when some big, movie changing **** was happening (Thor’s lightning scene jesus **** But Hulk’s snap was in that white ass, clinically lit room in such a tight shot, and you only know it worked because of **** Hawkeye, whose wife is calling him, who once again I will say I don’t give a singular **** about. It just seemed such a far cry from Thanos’s snap moment, and Iron Man’s final snap which were given the time and artistry that they deserved, considering they were LITERALLY movie changing scenes. Speaking of important, climactic scenes scenes, I feel like Captain Marvel wasn’t wonderfully incorporated. She seems to be a very divisive character, from people hating her standalone movie to the rumors that the cast hated Brie Larson, but honestly, if she could knock Thanos out and give him a fair fight, where was she this whole time? She is literally supposed to be the most powerful being in the universe, and she was on the sidelines for the majority of this movie. I will admit there were great scenes, like any Tony/Peter interaction and Cap finally getting his dance with Peggy. These are things that the fans of the MCU have probably been asking for since forever, and getting these moments was quite satisfying. However, Cap being able to wield Thor’s hammer, which happens in the comics and is quite a popular demand of the Russo brothers, was not well explained. Especially with all the **** that Thor went through, giving up this moment for him was a little bit devastating for a Thor fan, and ultimately made me feel like this movie did him SO **** DIRTY. Obviously that moment has its fans and it was pretty well done cinematically, but if Cap is holding Mjolnir, he has the power of Thor, making Thor pretty extraneous in this movie. Also, when was he deemed worthy (tbh I don’t love Cap and knowing all the **** Thor went through to get Mjolnir back when he wasn’t worthy it feels a little bit quick/rushed/convenient/lazy). I think that they could have left many things out (them listing time travel movies, as funny as that is, was at least 5 minutes of my life I could have gotten back) in favor of spending more time developing our last moments with these original Avengers that have shaped our modern conception of superheroes. I went in with incredibly high expectations, and this movie fell quite short of them, but honestly, it gave a lot of lip service to what the fans wanted, to a point where the movie just felt like funny clips strung together by a flimsy plot line. And it was a funny movie - to a point where every serious or dark or tragic movie was almost immediately undercut with levity. Ultimately I think this movie had to do too much and didn’t have the time or bandwidth to do it all perfectly, and I’ll miss all the original Avengers despite the failings of this movie.

"11 years and 20+ movies and it all builds up to a meh of a movie.It was average. The good parts were good, the bad parts were really, really badJokes were excessive in what should have been a dark film.Ant-man coming back after 5 years shows Marvel Studios don't even care about their own continuity. If 5 years in real life is only 5 hours in the Quantum Realm why was Janet old in Ant-man and the Wasp? People still mock the Martha scene from BvS but let's be honest, the ""Cap freezes up and stops fighting when someone mentions Bucky"" nonsense is way worse than the Martha scene. It's used AGAIN in this one. It's ridiculous.They borrow from Dragon Ball Z for how time travel works, that way they can mess with time with no repercussions.Widow's death was emotional manipulation, and ultimately felt forgettable after the fact. Tony's death was the only really good part of the movie because it felt like the right way to end it, especially knowing how the MCu started with Tony being a selfish playboy.Steve somehow can go back in time and live out his life and be old in the present, with no changes to the current timeline? It's so stupid. And he gives the Shield to Falcon? Ugh. They really are going full SJW with future movies, aren't they? Forgettable movie. It was average at best and as usual the critics show how biased they truly are where they call this movie ""Once in a generation"" when it's just another MCU movie that is meh at best. Rotten Tomatoes also shows the bias used to protect the scores of MCU movies (not just them deleting negative audience ratings for Captain Marvel but legit critic score they manipulate). One critic gave the film a 2/5 but their review was labelled as ""Fresh"". Mind you, a 2.5 for BvS was considered ""Rotten"". Amazing how that works, isn't it? How a 2/5 is Fresh but a higher rating is somehow rotten for a non-Disney comic movie? But there's no bias (sarcasm)They further ruin Hulk and Thor, and seeing Hulk dab had me ready to walk out of the theater. I gave this a higher score intially but remembering the dab brought my score down from a 4 to a 3Seeing Captain Marvel easily destroying a full powered Thanos and shrugging off his blow like it was nothing shows how big of a Mary Sue she's really going to be in future films. And I honestly believe before hey did a bunch of reshoots a few months ago she beat Thanos and saved the day, and after seeing reaction to her character and Larson's comments against a large chunk of their potential audience they changed it to Tony stopping Thanos with the stones to keep from alienating more of their fans with that shoehorned in character.This should have been the end of the MCU. But the franchise prints money because of people like the guy who made headlines for seeing Captain Marvel 116 times and the guy last year who saw Infinity War over 100 times in theaters. So bad to average movies will continue to dominate box offices, prompting other studios to follow suit, meaning the days of good filmmaking will continue to fade into memory",26 Abbott Close Enoggera NSW 6025
"Though Avengers: Endgame is filled to the brim with heart felt moments, the logically mess cannot be ignored. The editing, pacing, and writing are a giant mess and no matter how many awesome visuals or big moments occur on screen, these major issues cannot simply be ignored. The Russos have finally made a mediocre at best film and I would not be surprised if studio interference was a part of it. You can subjectively love this movie, but you cannot simply ignore the plethora of narrative and character issues that are strewn throughout this 3 hour mess.

3 hours is too long for a movie. The special effects were great. And it was cool to see all the characters together. But they either need to add an intermission or just make the movie shorter.,72 Adair Street Kangaroo Flat QLD 2153
This movie is excellent in almost ever way you can think of. The movie fells like fan service to all the long time fans and still is great for the new group of kids. Love this movie with all my heart.,162 Abercrombie Circuit Ellalong TAS 4715
"Solid Marvel pic but too long.  The movie is definitely fun and a “must see” if you’re even a mild Marvel fan.  Yet, be warned there’s nothing new here and with all the hype I expected more.  The first two thirds of the movie are really slow and the plot feels labored and stale.  The last third of the movie is more interesting - yet, even there, the fights seem totally redundant.  Although I enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it, I feel like this movie reinforces the idea that Marvel needs a fresh approach going forward.  Also, I have to comment on the length of the movie, three hours with no intermission just doesn’t work.  At least a third of the viewers in our theater had to get up and take a break during the screening... viewers of all ages by the way... so, I’d like to see either a shorter cut of the movie or an intermission built in...  its very distracting when people are moving in/out of the theater.",21 Abercrombie Circuit Glen Innes SA 2844
"movie had it's moments of ""awe"" and some very beautiful shots, but as a whole it was a huge disappointment, once the honeymoon phase is over in the next two weeks you'll see that with audience reviews and. scores.the good--Cap and Starks storyline came to a very nice conclusion--Cap being worthy of the hammer and assembling the avengers was the peak of the film--widow and hawkeyes moment before the soulstone was one of many tearjerkers of this movie--the visuals were amazing as alwaystoo much bad...--too long and not enough action, like over 2hrs of talking and just less than 45mins of actual action.--too much cringe from Cap Marvel every single scene she was in, way too OP, a healthy Thanos with all stones attacks her and she DOESN'T EVEN FLINCH AND JUST SMIRKS LIKE A MORON!! WTF is that??? lmao also she's so forced and such a last minute addition that there are too many plot holes with her. she's busy saving other worlds??? really?? Thanos is the biggest villain in the universe and has annihilated countless worlds within her jurisdiction, so where the **** was she? why hadn't she ""handled"" Thanos already???--they did Thor DIRTYYY, technically the most powerful of the earth heros, and goes through his character arc of Jerk hero full of himself, the downfall and finally his rise and belief in his ""godhood"" and completing his circle of the Thor that's close to his comic counterpart and king of Asgard....to being a basic ""fat clown"" in this movie, as if thats not bad enough he gives up his kindgom cause ""girl power"" so we can have a black female leading ""norse gods"" cause that makes sense.--Hulk isn't even hulk, he's just a nerd making jokes and never gets his chance at redemption and a cool fight with Thanos.--Black widow is killed off without her even getting her solo movie after having been in the movies the past decade...--the time travel arc was lame as hell and was not original whatsoever--Story was all over the place and convoluted ASF.honestly there's so much more to go on about but I'm sick of writing, will just post my reviews and forget about this movie ASAP. the rest of the MCU doesn't interest me aside from Guardians, especially if Thor is gonna be the new ""leader"" lol",3 Abercorn Crescent St Georges Basin QLD 4184
"These are my thought's. They killed off or retired any character that would have overshadowed Brie and the next MCU phase characters. It reminds me of my love affair with the season one of Macross saga aka (Robotech) anime from the 80s When that series ended with earth decimation I held my breath for what was to come after, and what came was a poorly constructed story minus my favourite characters. I don't not like this film, and I couldn't hate it if I tried too. Its a movie packed with fan service and a decent send-off I suppose. ""But I will be retiring with my favourite characters, and not returning for more. Let's hope the DCEU and Joker film will embrace me warmly."" Salute to the newer viewers Disney is making the films, for now, I hope they enjoy. truly Thanks, Russo bros",104 Abbott Street Currans Hill  2112
"Lets be fair we had high expectations and russos did not deliver, infinity war was way better than this. To begin they ruined thor after he got so boosted up, tons of loopholes, weak time travel plot, the only saving grace is the last fight.",16 Abernethy Street Marmong Point NSW 4069
"Wow, what a bloated disappointing mess of a finale. At 3 hours this is a boring and tedious film with phony drama and several humour miss-fires. A fat Thor gag is absurdly over done and sums up how tired and cynical this toy commercial is. Worst of all, the end is a re-run of the last film and I could only recommend this failure to the under 12's. If you liked Transformers, you'll like this.", Adinda Street Concord West NSW 7315
"Fantastic movie. The first half was pretty boring however. They spent way too much time on how the Avengers reacted to the deaths of everyone. The second half was great. The action was great and the emotional scenes hit hard. There was only one cringy scene in the movie and that's where all the female heroes moved in front of Spiderman and it panned around to look at them. I thought that was unnecessary. Overall, great movie and would highly recommend it.",21 Abercrombie Circuit Gunbower VIC 5608
"i was hesitant to give it a 5 or 6. after all its another braindead avengers movie by the same lazy hollywood studios that take their fan base for granted. a few nice moments in the movie, like the new hulk and thor scenes, but in generate stupid as **** as any other avengers movie. but i did give it a 6 in the end instead of a 5 just to celebrate the fact that this **** slide of MCU cringe movies is over. Cant wait for captain marvel to lead the MCU moving forward to a complete different league in the future of stupid ass ****ery that will ultimately make this crap MCU lineup seem like classic gold standards in comparison.",25 Adinda Street Tara VIC 4510
"I have watched all of the MCU and watch videos about the comics. I loved infinity war and this movie is definitely inferior to it. End Game had so much more to cover and conclude and falls short for it. The pacing suffers, going way to fast at the beginning yet dragging in the middle and then rushing the end. Also many characters are thrown aside, or even destroyed for the sake of convenience and comedy. Thor was probably the worst example. His whole very tragic story of everyone he loves dying and his vengeance fate but in this movie he is a useless, fat loser who even loses the one thing that makes him unique to the other heros, his ability to wield mjolnir, which can now be wielded by captain, which is cool, but in a film that trashes on thor, makes him feel even more pathetic. And I love Thor but even in the cinema I was in, when they are having their serious fight with Thanos, people were laughing at Thor just because he was fat. And Hulk was also severely side lined. After they cut him out of infinity war, fans were expecting to see him return and smash in the final fight, but he doesn't because he is (weirdly smaller) smarter hulk with a broken arm! The other thing that made me roll my entire body in the cinema in cringe was the political elements. There was dead silence every time captain Marvel showed up and no clapping or cheering for the feminist moment in the final fight. The way I see it is nobody wants politics in your movies! They also scared me by making me think captain Marvel was going to save the day but she does get slapped around so it balances out, as all things should be. In summary, infinity war had a better villain, better pacing and more emotional impact but you will enjoy it if you ignore the political jokes (and Brie Larson) and plot holes",17 Adinda Street Moss Vale VIC 4130
"I cannot say this movie was a solid 7/10. Many parts of it were 10/10, especially the parts surrounding the core Avengers, but the blatant fanfiction-tier politically motivated inserts brought the movie down in many ways. EDIT: Metacritic, WTF are you doing to my new lines?--Minor Spoilers follow--First, the good: This movie brings a solid and satisfying conclusion to the stories of some of the main avengers, and felt like a proper send-off to some of the best characters. The acting was A+, the effects were par for a Marvel movie, and the overall plot felt like a good continuation of Infinity War. --The Mixed-- This was kind of expected, but the way to figure out how to beat the most powerful being in the universe who has control of all of space and time felt like a giant deus ex machina. SPOILER: it's time travel. The Bad: Apparently, the original plan was to not feature Captain Marvel, and it shows. Her inclusions in the movie come out of left field and ultimately don't add much to the story. There were also a few scenes that broke continuity who's only purpose seemed to be to feature a bunch of female characters kicking butt. It felt as if they were just tacking things on to check off some boxes so the media hounds don't give them negative reviews. These things can be done well, as we saw with movies like Rogue One, but it was not done well here. Finally, there's never a rebuttal to Thanos's theory that the universe needs to be culled in order to survive. This theory was presented so strongly in Infinity War that I had a few friends thinking ""yeah, you know? Thanos was right. Thanos is the true hero!"". This movie does nothing to change our minds about that. To follow up on my Captain Marvel review, I called it (...mostly): Captain marvel is so powerful she singlehandedly wins the final battle for the Avengers, but she doesn't defeat Thanos. Frankly, it was pretty satisfying to see Thanos punch her smug face and send her flying, especially considering that was the first blow she receives on-screen after unlocking her full power in the Captain Marvel movie.",51 Abrahams Crescent Concord West VIC 2144
"Infinity War was a 10 for me...this was a 4.  Too many long & drawn out scenes.  Some jokes they took too far or went to the well too many times..THOR cough cough...Everyone will praise this film, I think it kinda sucked.",84 Ackland Place Tullymorgan NSW 6330
"So here is where all the threatened males are coming to rate the movie a zero because “women” have a moment in the movie, but they can’t quite give the movie a zero because it’s also the best super hero movie they have seen in their entire lives. So we get a lot of 5’s because the conflicted “fandom” of sensitive males can’t put aside their injured egos and rate this film honestly.Review: The movie doesn’t have the wall to wall action of Infinity War, but when the action comes, the impact is far more spectacular. The writing is spot on, the performances, the emotion... amazing. The only place I could dock this movie a point is trying to decide when to go pee because movie soft drinks and 3 hour runtimes are not a good mix for me.Do not see this movie unless you have seen at least the last episode of each the individual movies. The impact will be so much greater. But to everyone else... SEE THIS MOVIE NOW. This is the the movie event of this decade.",110 Abernethy Street Glenmore Park VIC 3150
"(RottenTomatoes)- They delete my reviews frequently and the ratings for movies are not as accurate. There time was good, but MetaCritic's time is now. Thank you MetaCritic for not denying people freedom of speech and being corrupt. The 3 hours was unnecessary. First hour is filled with bad jokes and lines that sound like they were written by 5 year old. They spend time on things that don't matter. We want to see Iron man struggle in creating the time machine, we want to see Captain marvel searching to find Iron-man, we want to see Ant-man being abandoned in the void. We don't want to see people eating with hulk at a dinner talking about how they shouldn't give up hope and that the time machine idea is good. Like, seriously way too much time in convincing people to do things that they shouldn't need convincing of or we DID NOT NEED TO SEE. Then Captain america ruined the whole time theory they set up. If he went back in time and married her, then that means there were 2 captain Americas and he somehow stayed in hiding never got recognized. But then also, in a previous movie he banged her child, so presumably that means either she was never born because he married her. OR perhaps that means Captain america always was with her and then that means he **** his own daughter. But still that would mean that there should currently be one old Captain america and a young one. But we only see the old one. There should be two. And the shield was also supposed to go to Bucky.    This project took years and it is just barely not ****. They made the first one good, so they didn't need to try on this one I guess.    The last movie felt like adults wrote the script, but this one seems like it was written by a girl in 8th grade.",5 Abercrombie Circuit Tambellup QLD 2036
"The movie is quite good, with a few notable incongruous moments dealing with that ""timey-wimey"" stuff.  I wasn't a fan of how the Captain Marvel character was used at all, but some of my fears there did not come to fruition so I can handle it.  Most of the issues are minor, and it's a substantive and worthy conclusion, overall.",64 Abbott Street Redbank Plains VIC 3023
The movie is OK. There's couple of characters and scenes that seem little bit or a lot(most people probably know what i mean)out of place and unnecessary. First Avengers movie was much better but this one is fun too.,308 Abrahams Crescent Toowoomba WA 4125
I was there at the beginning as Iron Man took flight for the fist time. I was there for the first Avengers I was there for Infinity War and everything in between. But the ending felt... hollow. It was funny it was even emotional but something was... off. It did not work. There was some forced stuff I will not get into and a ton of things that did not make any sense. The ending of the movie is a set up for things to come but it feels eerily similar to what happened in the comics industry. Good characters got destroyed and mediocrity took over in the name of misguided agendas.You can judge it best for yourself but I can't help but feel as if they could have done a lot better.,17 Abercrombie Circuit Northbridge QLD 4303
"All right so here it goes. Better than Infinity War? No. Bad movie? Absolutely not. My biggest problem with this movie is that it tries to bite too much and it can't chew most of it. Especially when it comes with the script, Endgame is a bunch of movies mashed together and it works (for the most part). They subvert our expectations in some good ways and bad ways, my biggest problem with this was what they did to Thanos. They kill the original in the first 10 minutes of the movie so the villain of this movie it's another Thanos from another timeline who doesn't have the same experience that the original Thanos has. And he is in this movie for 5 minutes or more. But I think this is my only problem with this movie, they really wasted Thanos which is the best villain (as of 2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.This is a 180 minutes movie and it really doesn't feel like it is which is an awesome thing and the directors and screenwriters should be commended by it, they really did a good job, the movie is the most fan service and that is great, Cap using Thor hammer is one of the best scenes in this franchise.Overall Endgame is a great movie that tries to do too much but I still think that is one of the best Marvel movies only losing to Infinity War.",4 Absolon Place Lauderdale NSW 3075
"It was an okey movie but it really dropped the ball at the ending.1. Tony Stark dies, i can accept it but.... They have all infinity stones + Hugo Strange that can heal any wounds with the time stone so his death made no sense.2. Thanos lost in a unfair match against Team Space in the last movie but in this one hes able to compete with everyone, even Thor that (might been out of shape) had both mjolnir and stormbreaker that could oneshot kill him.3. Mary Sue Marvel had no place in this movie, it hurt every moment she was on the screen.and at the ending where she came in saved everyone and could tank thanos attacks that beat the hulk into a coward because ""gurl power"". Really hoped she would die in this movie.4. Timetravel works if its parallell universes but Captain America deciding to stay in the past for some coochi was pretty bloody dumb and somehow still end up in the main time line?5. Thor giving the reigns to a random valkyrian. Thor is of noble blood and is suppose to sit on the throne, he cant just give it to a random valkyrian that havent been in asgard for over a million years. Would make more sense if he adopted earths democratic voting system instead.6. The girl power moment was cringe and out of place, and the scientist from black panther would have 100% died in a real war. 7. How did Ant-man survive a rocket that could destroy a whole house to the face?But the movie was still okey, but i think this will be the last avenger movie i will ever watch and just keep following Spider-man movies in the future.",12 Abercorn Crescent Revesby WA 3340
"Complete mess, shoehorned everything but the kitchen sink, and destroyed a golden path laid out by Infinity War, bits were really good but over all it is nothing but a word minced maze of lack of imaginations colliding. Been marvel my whole life, and now with this i am not. Thanks for nothing.",221 Abbott Street Raby SA 3169
"They say they want to make a good story, 11 years marvel, or 11 years from several characters? really many hole plots, and lazy writing. the infinity war is very good, but endgames make urinating less painful than seeing their stories.I have to say, i have a mixing feelings, as the fan. the services was good, but as movie lover, it didn't",156 Abercorn Crescent Clifton Springs NSW 2033
"Realmente no estamos ante evento cinematográfico del siglo. Es una película entretenida llena de conveniencias y algunos huecos de guion. No es insoportable pero tampoco es, como ya se dijo, lo mejor del Aquí algunas inconsistencias:- Capitán A. y el martillo de Thor es un gran Deus Ex Machina- La rata que libera a Ant Man es la mayor conveniencia de la película.- El hecho de que Thanos pudiera viajar al ""futuro"" es imposible, pues solo se había entregado dos frascos de partículas Pin a cada personaje, por ende entre Nebula y War Machine solo tenían 4, 2 fueron gastadas cuando ambos viajaron al ""pasado"" y la última cuando War Machine vuelve al ""presente"", por ende la última solo pudo ser usado por Nebula o Thanos, aunque finalmente todo su maldito ejército va al ""presente""-El hecho de que hayan tirado el guante con las gemas me hace pensar en una película slasher cuando los personajes tiran un arma a pesar de que están en peligro, en el caso de Avengers a pesar de que tienen el arma más peligrosa  -A su vez si hubieran usado el guente en la batalla con Thanos la película no se hubiera    alargado más, aunque esa batalla si estuvo buena.-Capitana Marvel al comienzo y al final llegando porque sí.- Al final Iron Man le quita las gemas a Thanos ¿cómo?, no importa mientras que los buenos ganen.- Aunque no afecte a la trama el Cap. viejo del final no tendría sentido si se sigue la lógica de la película, si aquello que sucede en un ""pasado"" realmente no afecta al futuro.",1 A'beckett Street Dulwich Hill NSW 7330

"22 movie has led to this garbage. Thank you MARVEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU FKING IDIOTS!I have Spider-Man tattoo in my whole arm, you know i'm a fanboy but this. this is just pure garbage movie.First of all, it's not even half of Infinity War.This movie is basically most expensive fan fiction movie of all time. All of the movie is just Star-Lord's Thanos slapping cheap. All of the motives, events everything is that much ridiculous.1) You fcking shove Captain Marvel into MCU before this. She is absent from movie. What the hell you forced her to MCU at this point. You don't need her.2)Everyone waiting for Hulk's revenge, but oh no! He is peacefull and powerless. It's not the same Hulk, he is shorter, smaller, and not powerfull as old one.3) You make Thor OP at IW, but oh no! He is fcking a loser now. He can't even hit a punch on Thanos. Everyone waiting for Thor but you wasted him. He killed Thanos with full Gauntlet but now he cant even hit stoneless Thanos. Bravo Marvel, f*cking Bravo.4)Some things should stay in comic pages. Comic has lots of ridiculous things. Captain America and Mjolnir is one of them. It's not working like that, that hammer won't go who ever calling it. You can't stay consistent with your rules. Also that idiot is not worthy, after everything happened Civil War and Infinity War is because of him. He is the biggest douchebag in MCU. Worthless bastard.5)Ant-Man's come back... All of the universe saved because of a rat. If there isn't a rat there all of the universe is just fked up...6)14 million possibilities and 1 success. It is really this one? If you saying this, i will look for all of the possibilities. You should make a ending with no other possiblities. But I can assure you the is a possibility there is Thor is not an idiot or Captain Marvel is actually usefull. Or Doctor Strange is just fking do something other than holding water... Marvel, you are just bunch of idiots you know. Hell, there should be a timeline that Thor hits Thanos' head or Ironman tooks stones and just runs, there is no need to use those but they should kill him you know, so he is used the stones... Captain Marvel can destroy that thrash can gauntlet with power, why the hell she didn't do that? Also why the fk Thanos did go to Nidavellir for Gauntlet? Stark can do this with Aluminium not even vibranium you know? And Hulk cried 5 hourse after stones but Ironman just talked with no problem... This movie is just **** garbage.",579 A'beckett Street Koah VIC 5108
"I saw the movie yesterday. I'm not a Marvel fan but I saw the Avengers saga and the last movie was good.- Captain Marvel appears at the beginning of the film with some effects taken from a class B movie following a scene with an extremely arrogant dialogue on his part front of the other Avengers. (Come on! you did not appear in the other movies!). Then she disappears during the next 2 hours of film (I guess she went to take a haircut in that time) and she returns to destroy Thanos' ship in a ridiculous way. No one on earth is capable of destroying it? Or do something? Come on!.- The Incredible Hulk takes two whole movies without even giving a slap. It is one of the most important characters in Marvel comics and his scenes seem that they were of a film of Shrek (With a little more of intellect).- Thor... I have no words to describe how they humiliated one of the strongest Avengers. Marvel should never again print a Thor comic after this. I hope to make a team with him in a videogame or see him in a pub sometime. (Or maybe one day I find him playing bowling with Walter).- I did not finish to understand the trips in the time. More precisely in the scene that Antman returns to the present. I do not remember if it was in a previous movie or when he set up that machine. A friend told me what happened in one of the 23 MCU movies. But if to understand 1 movie I must see 23 movies something is wrong. - Excessive humor in the whole movie. It also happened in all the saga. There are moments of tension that need some seriousness in the movies but are ruined by some silly joke.- Unnecessary feminist fight- I did not like the dialogue of the final scene with Thanos saying ""I am inevitable"" and Ironman answering ""I am Iron Man"". I think it would have been better if he said ""We are The Avengers"".Throughout the saga there were moments that seemed to be watching Iron Man movies with sporadic participation of some characters.That final dialogue finished confirming that the saga should be titled as ""Iron Man and The Advengers""- I think the duration was long, maybe 2 and a half hours (or a little less) would have been enough.They missed the opportunity to give a great closing to a saga that began from minor to major.I want to congratulate the sound director and his team. The rest take a break and rethink if you want to continue doing bad movies.",4 Abercrombie Circuit North Tamborine TAS 3175
"Very good overall though a little too long, the 'Time Heist' was a bit silly and some characters got too much screen time at the expense of others e.g. the awful Nebula is critical to the plot while we don't really get The Hulk.",17 Abbott Street Como VIC 4812

Fan service has never been done at this extent without having to forfeit story.I have seen it twice and I suspect I will see it more. Fantastic. Bravo. Thankyou.,239 Adamson Crescent Nairne VIC 3084
"22 films and 11 years later, Avengers: Endgame is the end of an incredible stage in film within the blockbuster branch.You can hate it but definitely you must recognize that what Marvel Studios built with this franchise is something that will hardly be seen again in this industry.Superhero films existed before Iron Man and the MCU but the ambition of this project completely surpassed everything else.That the audience that perhaps didn’t care about comic books at all was so involved with this saga and followed it until the end says a lot. The tears that the people next to me spilled in the theater only confirmed it.Like Infinity War this film may not be able to sustain itself without the whole concept but as I said at the time about that film I come to repeat here as well. This isn't about that.If after 22 interlaced films you can not understand it, what's the point of saying more about it?Its achievements are numerous. Even with three hours of duration the film never feels heavy, perhaps a little overwhelming for the amount of things happening at the same time but the narrative hardly falls into bumps that make it feel slow or boring.The story is emotional enough especially in the end, even when they reach levels never seen before of fan service, everything feels in its place and I think the most devoted fans will be satisfied.The final battle is spectacular, finally I felt as if I were watching a comic book taking life from the pages to the big screen because the scale and the number of characters make it the most epic battle of the whole saga.But even in spite of its achievements it also has its faults.Despite the lenght you can feel the holes in the story. The visual effects vary too much because in some points it looks pretty good and in others it gets to look very bad. Even the CGI varies in quality because the work is so detailed in Thanos but so simple in Hulk.Even the soundtrack in spite of the quality is not as emotive as that of Infinity War.And for the same reason due to the size of the plot, many characters end up reduced to very small moments in screen.And of the three characters that closed their circle in this film, I must say that the ending of Black Widow was quite bad compared to that of Iron Man and Captain America.Avengers: Endgame closes a cycle and closes it with solidity in a very entertaining show.It's the film that was expected to be and as I said closes a monumental chapter in this franchise in terms of narrative and characters and at the same time laying the foundations for what is to come.Will a new saga of 10 years and more films follow? I don't know, and part of me doubts it, but no matter what happens in the coming years, the achievements of this franchise will undoubtedly be unforgettable for a lot of people.",68 Adcock Place Wights Mountain NT 2097
Avengers: Endgame is my new favorite movie of all time! It is just amazing!,176 Adamson Crescent Granville QLD 
"The best marvel movie to date that is no question, don't want to write any spoilers but it has a satisfying ending, wraps up perfectly that last 10 yrs. There is some aspect of the movie that not everybody will like, but just think about how hard to fit 20 characters in one movie and write them into the story, except 1 character they pulled it off brilliantly. Hard to write it without any spoilers, but for any comic-books fan it a must. For everyone else, don't think about it too hard, just enjoy the ride.",15 Abrahams Crescent Castlemaine QLD 4169
"Major plotholes, terrible pacing, long movie for no reason(could've been 2 hours easily),  Hulk is Yamcha, forced characters, crapped on Thor, many casuals didn't care for the Stan Lee cameo, cheap drama tricks, etc. Over done time travel story with plotholes. The only redeeming factors being a few decent jokes, The first 20 minutes and last 30 minutes.Extremely overhyped and really just for the casual Marvel audience. Two extra hours of lame fan service. Disappointing. If I was new to Marvel I understand why it's big but I'm not. It's generic if anything.",215 Abercrombie Circuit Mount Riverview VIC 2066
"Probably the largest scale film of our generation, with plenty of action and heart felt moments. Unfortunately, some of the plot holes are too big to forgive and forget and, at times, didn't even feel like an Avengers film.",24 Adkinson Close Woodville Park VIC 2284
"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell.", Adamson Crescent Ashgrove  2031
The combination of 21 films does not disappoint. It’s not your typical Marvel movie as the Russo’s make this one different yet great like all there MCU films. This is an absolute blast of a film with so many emotional moments I’d be shocked if you didn’t cry. It has so many callbacks to past movies you wouldn’t be wasting your time rewatching every MCU film. Just wow. This film is amazing.,15 Adinda Street Coomera  3161
"Great movie, sadly some of the plot holes and overly funny scenes make this movie not perfection. But in summary, this is still a worthwhile movie for MCU's 11-year journey",34 Abbott Street Parmelia VIC 2749
"It's really good. They've done what needed to be done to conclude the saga, abandoning the usual cheesy ways superhero's movies end, and makes you understand that all Marvel movies til now were made in prior to this movie. I still prefer Infinity War over Endgame for being packed with more action (and badass) scenes, as Endgame is slower paced. But in a much more real sense, you'll love this either way, I saw people cry, laugh and shock themselves on the session. It's worth every penny and every second.",113 A'beckett Street East Roseville WA 3121
"It was a good movie for sure, but not great. I think found the biggest issues it faced were that they just have too many big characters in the Avengers that you simply can't do justice to them all - credit where credit is due they did pretty well. In fairness they did focus heavily on the older characters, and rightly so, however it missed an opportunity to do more with the newer ones as a result. Also Capt Marvel is way to over powered. I was also hoping for more of a feel good ending, this is why we watch these movies right? Anyway all in all it was a good run, but not as good as its predecessors in my opinion.",56 A'beckett Street Mount Eliza VIC 2170
"All in all I thought it was good movie, to sum it up in one word bittersweet. There were a lot of plot holes but they were ignorable for the most part. I really liked how they used captain marvel, and that Tony and Thor got some revenge. I thought what they did with Thor was abysmal, they could of handled that so much better than making him the dude. Professor Hulk was cool, but Hawkeye's Ronan story arc stole the show for the most part. The end war was visually stunning and action packed. the 3 on 1 scene with cap, tony and thor was so awesome. This was a great ending to a decade of movies, everyone was tied in at the end, that kind of story telling and character development is extremely impressive. I think that is the end of my MCU experience as they transition into phase 4 I think I have had enough. Thanks Marvel for over a decade of bringing the comics to life.4",46 Adamson Crescent Lysterfield VIC 4074
Worst Marvel movie ...............................................................................,5 Adinda Street Summer Hill NSW 5096
It wasn't that good of a movie. It didn't have enough action. I don't know why people are saying this movie is that good. I also didn't think it was that funny.,9 Abercrombie Circuit Proserpine WA 6008
"This review contains spoilers...For a 3 hour movie there is surprisingly little action. Central characters like Thor and the Hulk did hardly anything and were just lame. Captain Marvel was supposed to be their knight in shining armour but she was hardly in it at all and at the end fails to best Thanos one on one, even though she's just blasted through the middle of a giant space cruiser. I really thought she would be his downfall. If you're going to hype her up that much, make sure she's really a solid element of the film. Too much dialogue, too many sentimental moments. Ending it on Tony's Stark's funeral was just a downer when really you wanted some real cathartic, happy times after the bleakness of Infinity War. It's not even clear how Stark gets the stones from Thanos as one minute they're lodged in this glove and then next minute Stark has them without you even knowing why. Annoying that Black Widow has to die and they couldn't figure out another way to get the soul stone. Hawkeye's rage filled murdering spree near the beginning feels kind of forced and weird. Stupid humour that went way over the top, like Thor becoming a complete loser. It was funny for the first five minutes but when you realised how much they'd nerfed his powers you just felt disappointed, especially after how badass he was in Ragnarok. He was almost discounted from contributing altogether and was just pathetic. Stark's banter with his daughter was just cringey. Why did hulk wearing the infinity gauntlet for 10 seconds manage to restore the earth again? That wasn't explained but maybe I missed it. This always happens, when the hype is so high things go the other way. Captain Marvel's movie was dire as well. For me, although DC have a worse track record, Marvel still haven't topped Wonder Woman. Their new joker movie looks top notch too. Just hoping Guardians 3 is good.",18 Abernethy Street Wendouree QLD 3107

Extremely overhyped for no reason i suspect Disney paid reviewers to give good scores. Plot holes were everywhere and half of the movie was chit-chat and weird mix of drama and comedy. At the end it felt like a cheesy movie made for teenagers i was not impressed,85 Abercrombie Circuit Rosebud SA 2035
The movie was quite a let down as compared to infinity war. I felt the movie was plagued by numerous plot holes. The movie also felt very sluggish as it progressed.

"I wanted to like this movie. I truly did. I was disappointed with some poor writing in Infinity War and hoped this would repair some of that. It degraded to much worse.I cannot believe people in general are not disappointed with the depth of the story of these past 2 movies.Cons----The time travel is horribly inconsistent and all over the place. The only rules it follows are there are no rules but what we need for the very weak plot.-Characters are purposely watered down to advance the plot. Thor is the latest victim. Hulk was IW.-Scale. Somewhere,the Russos forgot or just genuinely do not care that all the heroes are not the same and have differing abilities.Some of them are regular humans and cannot take a punch from a super powered being or a rocket to the face.  Thanos with or without Gauntlet is inconsistently powered. Cannot stand against Scarlet Witch yet can against Thor powered Captain America and Thor with stormbreaker. I was glad to see Scarlet Witch utilized better, dont get me wrong, but please stick to some sort of power scale here.-Unnecessary Bad Humor. It would have been a better movie with a more flushed out battle giving each character their unique moment than making Fortnite and dapping jokes.-Terrible representation of characters. I was excited about Professor Hulk (from Toys and general promotion it was obvious) only to find no explanation for it and it was just a plot device to keep him out of the fight again.Thor was just a disgrace of a representation. I truly have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Making fun of depression and alcoholism and degrading Thor to this was just dumb. Everyone from Wakanda were just shoehorned into the movie. They had no special moments and were generally just pushed around. Emerging from the portal was their strongest moment.The only fight scene Black Widow had was against Clint. She had minimal role in the rest of the movie. Never truly did anything but die. Had no funeral whatsoever at the end like Tony and was forgotten.Spider-Man was nothing short of useless in this movie. Same can be said of Wasp, Groot, Drax and Star-Lord.Doctor Strange was kept busy with a flood as a plot device.-Clear agenda (that didnt work in the comics either)The ""girl power"" moment was unnecessary and cringe worthy. Forced moments like this are dis-genuine and transparent. Captain Marvel is just setup as a Mary Sue. Saves Iron Man/Nebula with no real story. Clearly overpowered in final battle. If this is the future of Marvel, it seems it is headed for some truly poor writing. A character who is basically the annoying kid you used to play Super Heroes with who made up powers as they went along so you could never win.She has no weaknesses and is basically more powerful than anyone because they decided she is. Nevermind, Shuri who was established as the smartest human in the MCU and her possibly emerging as IronHeart(also a genuinely more like-able actor)..Nope...we are going to go the 9 year old kid version of this. Oh...and of the people we have killed off in these movies, 2 of them are strong females who established themselves as likable heroes with distinct abilities and personalities.I have zero issue with female representation (would rather see She-Hulk introduced myself but that is personal), I do have an issue with poor writing and plot armor. Pros---Callbacks to the timeline.I enjoyed almost every scene with the throwback to the original Avengers movie. Thor visiting his mother was a good moment.Tony and his Dad were well done.-Rocket. Continues to be one of the best Marvel characters whose humor works.Overall, just an extreme disappointment. I thought the original Avengers and Ultron were very well written movies that setup the franchise. I do not feel much different that what happened with the transition from JJ Abrams to Rian Johnson than I do with the transition of Whedon to the Russos. Very poorly handled.I realize that these are Directors not writers, but the Directors decide what storylines get into the movie and which ones do not. Saves Tony Stark/Nebula for no reason whatsoever but a plot device and to push the agenda of Captain Marvel being the most powerful. Just knows that Tony is stranded in an infinite void of space to save him at the last minute.",20 Abrahams Crescent Dover Gardens NSW 3046
"Not being a blind fanboy or been effected by hype, I can say that,The end game definitely lives up the hype but, only for last 30-45mins. The first half of the movie was filled up more with funny humour and unexpected condition of heroes after losing to Thanos in infinity war. Inshort, it falls flat in my opinion.I personally feel that Infinity war was better than end game due to ""powerful"" foundation of story and the fear of Thanos was very well projected.",23 Adair Street Narrandera VIC 4000
RDJ's best ever performance and a fitting end to a franchise. Even brie larson's utter awfulness as an actor and character wasn't enough to detract from it. truly a masterpiece to thank Russo's for. must watch., Abrahams Crescent Seven Hills WA 3175
"Endgame was a major disappointment. Long overly drawn out tear jerking scenes mixed up with weak humor, plot holes and too few fight scenes plagued with very inconsistent power levels.Not to speak of what they did to many of the characters which can hardly be recognized (this goes beyond a certain Asgardian).Despite the overly long running time the movie fails to give many important characters sufficient screen time. The plot is extremely thin and telegraphed providing little tension or suspense except the in last 20 minutes.TL;DR Endgame is too long a movie trying to mix drama and superhero humor, with poor results. This movie can't hold a candle to its predecessor infinity wars.",48 Abernethy Street Rossmoyne WA 2350
"The movie is ""okay"", but can´t reach the same intensity like Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly to say, that the production team missed the opportunity to deliver a milestone in superhero cinema. The effects and the shooting is top notch, but unfortunately that´s not all. It just looked like ""work on schedule"". So, don´t believe the media hype and don´t set your expections to high. Entertaining, but nothing more...",6 Abrahams Crescent Magill NSW 6516
"Ah, Avengers: Endgame. The movie that the world was waiting for for about 10 years now? Anyways, let's get straight to the point. This movie is an extremely mixed bag for me. While there's many moments in here that are just breath-taking and badass, there's also a large number of scenes that just had me cringing.First off, let's go over the positives. For anyone who has watched the movie, you know how awesome it was to see Captain America pick up Mjolnir and wail on Thanos. It was a very awe-inspiring scene and was just overall REALLY a fun watch. Similarly to this but with more consequence, when Iron Man acquired the Infinity Stones and snapped Thanos' forces away, that was also just as if not possibly more epic than Capt. America's feat of fighting Thanos with Mjolnir. Was also fun to see Ant-Man knock down a Chitari flying whale with just his giant form, but that's just me fanboying Ant-Man.Another positive is the character arcs that both Capt. America and Iron Man go through over the course of the movie as they re-meet old friends and family as they travel across time trying to re-acquire the Infinity Stones. Now onto the negatives, and oh boy is there a bit to cover.First off, this movie, no matter how many people might tell you otherwise, is FULL of SJW moments very clearly. Let's list them off, shall we?:1. Thor, the white male that he is, has grown to be a lardy alcoholic in this movie that apparently can't even take on base Thanos while Capt. Marvel can effortlessly tank a headbutt from Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet? Nice clear SJWism.2. During the middle of the fight with Thanos, a bunch of the superwomen gather up together and start to wail on Thanos' forces, while all the men're just sitting in the sidelines like a bunch of sissies. This just goes to show the same ol', same ol' trope of ""GIRL POWERRRR!"" in modern Mary Sue-filled movies.3. Another showing of feminist/SJW propaganda in this movie is Thor just randomly handing off the title of king of Asgard to the random Valkyrie chick we met and saw only a few movies ago. All of that after seeing him become a tub of lard? His character ruined? It's quite pathetic what they did to him, now he just runs around with the Guardians of the Galaxy and'll do who knows what for who knows how long.4. Capt. America handing off the title of, well, Capt. America to a black guy, specifically Falcon, is another showing of stupid disregard for character in exchange for blatant SJW propaganda. Honestly, it's completely out-of-character for Steve to hand out the shield to Falcon instead of Bucky. He very clearly has a much bigger and better relationship with Bucky, so why hand it to Falcon? It's just dumb and completely takes you out of the otherwise surreal experience of seeing Cap as an oldie.I could go on and on about why SJWism is what's ruining this movie, but it has flaws even aside from that. The movie is very uneventful, and very boring as a result. Many a moment, I'd find myself just wanting the movie to be over so I could take a bathroom break. And many of my friends have made the same claims. It's just not as fun to watch as the other movies, minus those few moments Cap and Iron Man had near the end of the film (but we know what happened to both of them, now don't we?).If you just want to finish off the Marvel movies with a bit of a banger, this is the movie for you. It has some badass moments for many fan favs like Cap and Iron Man, and really builds up the fanservice with the final fight.All this considered however, the movie is absolutely LITTERED with SJW garbage that really detracts from the experience for someone with more right-leaning viewpoints. If you're one of those kinda people like me, do or don't see this movie, but most certainly avoid the assuredly SJW phase 4 of the MCU Marvel Studios will be churning out in the not-so-distant future.",15 Abercorn Crescent Tweed Heads QLD 3844
"The biggest problem with Endgame is that it is far too long. Right from the start it has ponderously long scenes. The same story could have been presented in 2 hours without losing a word. Other problems include never learning why Dr. Strange did what he did at the end of Infinity War, a funny but unexplained change to the Hulk, and a major plot device we have already seen in an X-Men movie, a plot device that renders all drama going forward meaningless. Nothing that happens in the next Spider-Man movie, nothing that happens in the upcoming Black Widow movie, matters ... at all. All problems are now, according to what Endgame established, completely fixable after the fact. Finally, Captain Marvel is MUCH too powerful. In one scene (I'll be vague to avoid spoilers) she destroys something very very very large simply by flying through it. If she can do that, none of the other Avengers are really even relevant. Also, I recall that no one but Thor could lift Thor's hammer, so why is Captain America running around with it like it weighs 10 pounds?The good stuff: great scenes with Tony Stark; great scenes with Steve Rogers. In fact, without the personal touches regarding Tony and Steve I would have given this movie a 5. There were a handful of jokes that made the audience roar with laughter but I was in the last row and the jokes were spoken so softly by the characters I couldn't hear what was being said. But I will assume they were great and so list them under the positives.And that's about it. Not spectacular. Though I do give the writers credit for weaving so many characters into the mix (though not enough Black Widow fight scenes for my taste).",22 Abbott Close Mystic Park VIC 2232
"A lot of plot holes, Captain Marvel with the speed above light to bring Iron Man back, Nebula bringing all Thanos' troop without even a **** Pym Particle.In the previous installment Thor almost killed Thanos equiped with the 6 gems, now he gets kicked in the ass by a Gemless Thanos just because he got fat? (WTF IS THAT?)TerribleGet better MCU.",4 Acraman Place Cape Jervis QLD 3196
"I I am very upset. They killed Our Marvel Heros because they didn't want a happy ending? Seriously? It's a movie, I don't go to the movies to cry I go to leave my reality and enter a dream world were everything is perfect, especially our Marvel characters. They had a da m time stone. Reverse time and bring everyone back alive, end of story!I hate that Captain Marvel didn't save the day like she was supposed too. I hate that they women had a small part in this movie and I'm not a feminist. They made it an Iron Man and Captain America movie. Then nobody could take down Thanos? Come man, you use his weaknesses to take him down.The reason people ran to see this movie because they wanted to see what happens.I'm very disappointed. I felt like this was rushed to make a dime off of hard core fans. I gave it two stars because the war at the end was the best part!The End!",511 Abercorn Crescent Campsie NSW 4020
"A film that really needs no introduction, all us superhero fans have been waiting for this moment for so long and it’s finally here. I still remember seeing the first Iron Man movie in the cinema and I never would have thought it would bring us here. As always this is a spoiler free review but I do recommend avoiding all reviews until you’ve seen Avengers: Endgame for yourself. Honestly you should avoid all reviews and social media in general because not all of us are adhering to the #DontSpoilTheEndgame request by the Russo Brothers. So if you’re the type of person who would intentionally spoil a film like this for someone else you’re the type of person who deserves to be wiped out with a single snap of the fingers.Set immediately after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, the universe is trying to come to terms with the devastating effects after half of the universe have been wiped out. The remaining Avengers are determined to do whatever it takes to try and undo Thano’s actions. I wouldn’t be a huge fan of all the Marvel movies, Age of Ultron and Civil War for me had a lot of problems yet what saved them was the characters and what drives Endgame is the characters we’ve come to know and love over this long journey. I loved Endgame, my heart was racing, I was on the edge of my seat. All the previous films have led up to this moment and no time is wasted diving straight in. With a three hour running time it’s not the type of film you want to buy a giant bucket of coke for unless you’re prepared to leave the cinema to use the bathroom, because don’t let these so called online bathroom guides fool you, there is no part of Endgame worth missing. I can’t speak for everyone but those were the quickest three hours of my life. Despite that I did feel a certain few characters were not given the screen time they maybe deserved, though I understand it would be difficult to give everyone their moment with a cast this big, even with the lengthy running time it just isn’t possible. Though maybe we could have done with a little less of the Hulk eating lunch and a little more Okoye, whatever I’ll get over it.You’ll laugh, you’ll cry and you’ll cheer along with the film. There’s nothing better than being in a packed cinema screen with die-hard fans of the franchise. A spectacular cinematic achievement with a very satisfying ending. A real sense of closure, yes that means no post credits scene so feel free to make a mad dash for the bathroom if you’re not a blubbering mess by the end.It may go without saying but yes you really do have to have seen most of the other Avenger movies, if you haven’t you really won’t get much out of Endgame. Highly recommended but honestly I don’t need to recommend this one do I? You’ve already seen it, it’s made over 1 billion on it’s opening weekend and will continue to break all the records.",4 A'beckett Street Toowoomba VIC 2076
"Just a megamix with all heroes and timelines, they should finish movie after cutting Tanos' head, come on, dude just was chilling in his house cooking a soup. This movie is just a fan service, not a movie itself, just pieces of some situations. I just wish Tanos could snap this dudes away again.Music in the end is a remix of Alan Silvestri's Predator (1987) movie. So, OST is dull, Captain Marvel feminized with short hairs and arrogant (she was ok in solo movie, but here).Plot holes, feminism stuff, Thor Lebowski and the return of the worst Spider-Man. RIP MARVEL, it died with Stan Lee.",7 Adinda Street Toolijooa NSW 3216

"Disappointed in the route they chose to go with this movie. Infinity War was a masterpiece that fully developed Thanos as the Mad Titan. With him beating down the Hulk, Thor, and killing Loki in the opening scene the stage is set that this is a real villain. He completed his mission beat the avengers and obtained the stones which he used to kill half of the universe. He even sacrificed his daughter in the process. All this leads into Endgame where he is easily killed  with not much of a fight in the first 20 minutes and has destroyed the stones he has worked so hard to get. It makes no sense. So instead of a movie that builds up to the defeat of Thanos and the team finding some way to bring back the others we are left with a cheap time travel plot. This was brought into the movie to give the audience a trip down memory lane revisiting old movies and for no other reason. The visuals are great as always just sucks they took what could of been an epic conclusion and turned into a popcorn flick with forced fan service forced emotional scenes and forced bad humor. This movie lacks the suspense, tension, pace, that Infinity War mastered.",21 Abercrombie Circuit Oakleigh NSW 7250
"Good, a solid movie that reconnet and offer closure to some aspects of the franchise...after about 10 years of Marvel cinematic universe it wasn't an easy task to accomplish. Kudos to that.  But It's a little inferior to Infinity war or Avengers 1:Some parts are well made but other not so much...like the majority of the humorous parts (too many and too silly). Thor and Hulk are really bad represented here.Other than that it's a must watch..the day after the movie premiere I spotted people (and tv news) in my country talking about superheroes and not about the last soccer match...for and old nerd like me It's a little revolution...and in a good way.",29 Adair Street Penrith VIC 2343

"A bit of a mess...But it might grow on me.This movie was not nearly as tight and orderly as Infinity War.  It had way too much going on, got bogged down in too many needless scenes that dragged too long and poorly told jokes that did not stick like they usually do.The final battle did not have nearly as much action as expected.  And since it was against time-travel Thanos it really didn't feel like it was against the real Thanos from Infinity War.  A missed opportunity.The Russo Brothers said they wanted to dedicate this one to the fans.  If you want to please the fans, then make a great movie.",3 Abercorn Crescent Thornleigh NSW 4184

"In short, while the movie was very enjoyable and had it's golden moments of fan service, there were many things in this movie that prevented it from being a completely fulfilling conclusion to the franchise.I'm just going to list off everything this movie did right, and everything this movie did wrong and leave it at that;WHAT WENT RIGHT;- Unpredictability- Fan Service- Final Battle- Use of different method of time travel- Halkeye's family in the beginning- Not making Captain Marvel an absolute core to the movie since she only got recently introduced- Special effects- Good character closure (except Cap returning as an old man wasn't exactly necessary, and it would have been sweeter and more dramatic if he simply left with Peggy without a trace).WHAT WENT WRONG- Doesn't truly make sure of the 3 hour run time; a lot of it is empty or could have definitely be used for building up the ending more.- Very uneven pacing- Tries to be too funny and casual at times when humour and being casual is the exact opposite of what is necessary- Doesn't focus enough on the truly devastating affects of the snap enough to invoke anger, fear and hopeless into the audience- Hulk's character got completely butchered and side-lined- Thor being fat and a loser was unpredictable and funny for the first while, but a big mistake in the long run since it made all his scenes too funny and awkward- Quantun Realm Deus Ex Machina (it would have been cooler if Dr. Strange did send the Time Stone to the future for the Avengers to study and invent time travel tech from)",77 Adinda Street Hackham West VIC 2570
"Crazy disappointing is probably the best way I can describe this movie. I feel like giving it a 2, but to be fair a 6 is probably what it deserves. The reason I feel like giving this movie such a low score is because it was so hyped for so long building anticipation and then totally mailing it in. I admit I am a huge comic book fan and because of this I have seen every MCU movies with the exception of only making it about 75% of the way through Captain Marvel. I have become much more lenient on expecting movies to follow comic book plots and even encouraged change if I thought it was for the better. In this case they had a perfect example to adapt from in Jim Starlin's Infinity Gauntlet series. I already knew from the first part IW and due to contractual obligations these movies would be much different from the comics, but I was not expecting this. This movie throws away all the awesome scenes from the comic to replace them with lame callbacks to old movies, dragging characters through the mud like Thor and Hulk and setting things up for the ANAD Marvel characters in the future which are the worst of all the comic characters (Thanks Disney). The time travel plot was lame poorly executed and riddled this thing with plot holes. Most of the movie was boring and I felt no emotional investment. Characters I have loved fro more than 20 years died or had their final big moments in this film and I felt nothing because it was so poorly executed. I am not arrogant enough as a comic book fan to say I will never watch another MCU movie again with some of my favorite characters like Doctor Doom and the X-men joining, but I plan on skipping a lot of these until they prove to me they have their **** together.",6 A'beckett Street Glenbrook VIC 2230
"Overall too mediocre plot and too overhyped movie. 2.5 hours of reflexion and flashbacks, 10 minutes of action and 20 minutes of condolesences. Tanos shifts motives like he has a PMS. Thor is depicted a clown. Captain Marvel is added just to approve feminists' trends. Too dissapointing even for the marvel fanboys.",28 Adams Place Torquay QLD 4211

"Avengers: Endgame is an amazing cinematic experience. It had just enough action, it was emotional, and hilarious. My favorite action scene was the final battle. The moment the portals showed up and all the dusted Avengers came out of the portals I was hyperventilating. My favorite emotional scene would have to be Tony sacrificing himself to save millions. Thanos did not last long whatsoever in the hands of Iron Man. Finally, my favorite hilarious scene would have to be Thor taking the headset and threatening to fly to Noobslayer's house, take his arms off, and shove them up his ass. Every theory I came up with was true. I theorized that the Quantum Realm would have a role in the plot, I theorized that the dusted Avengers would come back, and I theorized that we would get Professor Hulk.    There were a few things that I didn't like much about the movie. In the beginning when Tony was sleeping on the Benatar then Captain Marvel shows up, the movie doesn't explain how she found him and Bruce Banner did not have many action scenes at all. The only action scene that I can remember was Bruce lazily acting like Hulk. Besides all my dislikes I really liked this movie. It's amazing how easy the Russo Brothers can make Box Office hits.",20 Abercrombie Court Joondalup VIC 2030

It is by all means not a bad movue. It is just simply a borring one. Mediocre.",11 Adkinson Close Toormina NSW 7260
"Most movies are lucky two have one memorable scene that sticks out and becomes the major moment of the movie. Endgame is blessed with being filled with them. A great ending to a story 11 years in the making, Endgame is only hindered by a few points that seem to hinder the overall pacing of the movie. Let's be honest, at this point we don't want to see exposition dumped, we want to see a bloodbath.",31 Abercorn Crescent Kyabram NSW 2602
"The movie is pretty bad. The time travel mechanics make no sense, the choreography of the end fight doesn't make sense, it lacks any sense of geography (even Michael Bay fights have some), this is specially disssapointing because the Russo Brothers previous film did had some. In contrast this is an overcrowded mess, that is impossible to follow, I hate CGI generic debris, you can tell they were just hitting the air at a green screen. The main villian is such dissapointment from the previous film, such a downgrade, Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean 3 comes to mind. For all the cameos, not a single contributes to anything, you could remove some and the plot would be the same,the dialogue is mostly interchangable among most characters too. Worse part is the conflict that made the heroes lose on the previous film, as well as the Pseudo-Civil War where nobody died), is resolved off-screen. Nobody learns anything they just win by facing the equivalent of a Baby version, that's cheating.Then everyone knows you shouldn't alter the past,.nor create alternate dimensions for selfish reasons. What this hero does, it makes Rick & Morty's Rick Sanchez look like a decent person. Is creepy. And resurectimg characters is always bad",4 Abercorn Crescent Oldbury SA 5550

"Most fans expected that ""Avengers: Endgame"" will resort to time travel to make everything right. It is the same idea of ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Three moments made ""Avengers: Endgame"" terrific but not a masterpiece, the 1st one is killing Thanos by Thor at the beginning, 2nd one is the sacrifice of Black Widow, and the last one is the death of Iron Man, actually these three unexpected moments shocked all Avengers fans.I have also some negative comments starting with the purpose of Captain Marvel in Endgame!! Actually the only role for her is saving Iron man from a lonely death in space!! The other thing is the final battle, in my humble opinion, it was chaotic as same as White Walker battle in Game of Thrones, also the time travel was a bit hasty and unconvinced, especially in the way of retrieving the infinity stones.Anyway, ""Avengers: Endgame"" is the final movie in the Avengers series, and its ending is a good way to say goodbye.",688 A'beckett Street Belgrave VIC 2097

"There are way too many plot holes in this work of fiction to even understand what's going on. The movie spends so much time building its own time-travel logic to end up breaking its own rules at the end. This raises a lot of questions about things they could've done instead. Hulk accidentally discovered the secret of immortality and it was completely dismissed as a failure. There's also a lot of inconsistencies. Namely, Captain Marvel one shotting Thanos spaceship and later easily being thrown away by Thanos. Yet, even mundane characters could fight with Thanos on a similar strength for a while. Why didn't those other people one shot the ship if they all could? The movies are getting so ridiculous that some actors -too ashamed to continue- decided to opt out of the next entries by leaving their characters to die.",26 A'beckett Street Port Macquarie NSW 3030

Endgame delivers despite the audience knowing where things are headed. What will be tough to endure is a MCU where key characters may not be around because of events within Endgame.

"Delivers.Endgame is the epic conclusion to the battle against Thanks we were promised. An emotional conflict that sees The Avengers going from broken and forlorn, to reflexive, to strong again and everything in between. The power of seeing these characters go through this journey is the heart and soul of the movie, and is not to be under estimated. The majority of the three hour running time forsakes action to explore the effects Infinity War had on who these heroes have become, and yet it's no less exciting than anything that's come before.Some necessary, if minor improvements have been made that will help the MCU moving forward should Disney and Marvel stand firm in retaining this level of quality in future endeavors. For example, I've complained about subpar CGI in quite a few of these movies that seems to arise from a lack of effort being put in, rather than budgetary constraints. Here though there's not a lackluster visual to be found. I understand they realized the need to pull out all of the stops for this one and therefore phoned nothing in. A mentality that should be applied to every MCU film going forward.Brie Larson also improves in her role as Captain Marvel. She doesn't have much screen time at all, but what few scenes she does have show much more natural her performance is this time around. I'm beginning to retroactively feel that my issues with her acting in the standalone movie were more the result of the directors as opposed to the actress herself. The character of Danvers herself though could probably still use a little tweaking to make her likable though.Endgame also deals with darker content than one would expect from a MCU flick. On top of dealing with themes of hopelessness and regret stemming from how The Avengers defeat led to the deaths of so many, the violence is also quite shocking for a film of this nature. There's a decapitation right at the start of the movie and a perfectly visible slit throat for audiences to gawk at, among other bloody scenes. It's interesting to see stuff like this given the relatively wholesome nature these films have been known for and I'm curious to see what kind of content this opens the MCU on the big-screen up to in the future (they've been doing more graphic stuff like this on the television tie-ins for a while now).A lot of this movie is going to mean nothing to those who haven't followed this journey across the other 20 or so films that came before it. You might still get some entertainment from the humor and spectacle, but will be totally lost on who these people are, what's going on, and miss out on the real impact of Endgame. This is for the fans. For them it's an ending and a new beginning for a world they've been following for years now. With events that radically and forever change the face of cinema's first shared universe.9.3/10",14 Adair Street Bracknell VIC 6210
"Boring, predictable, not intense, wanted to sleep many times during this unnecessary 3 hours of lame dialogs.Feminism is a crucial part of Hollywood, so of course there are some scenes just about that, it isn't so bad. BUT! Captain Marvel ruins any common sense and conflict in story, if there were no other characters the final wouldn't really change, because there is nothing that she couldn't do just by herself. There cannot be any good story in the universe where 1 character could potentially solve all the problems, but this character doesn't do it for no reason whatsoever.",8 Adair Street Port Pirie QLD 2474

"A great ending to a long-running cinematic storyline. The acting was great, and the movie's length worked to its advantage to set scenes before diving into main plot points. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was stellar especially, and Tom Holland was especially enjoyable during the final, chaotic fight scene. It is not a perfect movie, but a great watch with a tear-jerking ending, a great end to Tony Stark's character arc.",5 Abercrombie Circuit Ruse NSW 3564

"What a rollercoaster ride the movie Avengers: Endgame was!

"Avengers: Endgame was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. While I felt it was step up from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame still disappointed me on an entertainment level. I understand that it’s really hard to live up to the massive hype and satisfy fans with a pre-written storyline, but the slow pacing of Endgame was really frustrating at times. It felt like separate movies playing out at different times, fitted into one movie. The entire first two hours didn’t really give me any surprises, although I was still entertained at times. However, the final battle in the last third of the movie was incredible and the storyline started to draw me in until the final scene. All in all, Endgame was a letdown for me, but I was still entertained for a minor part of the film. (56/100)",6 A'beckett Street Yass NSW 6288
It's the Endgame. Nuff' Said. I was happy with it. It is unlike probably anything else in cinematic history. The last hour of this film alone is just what I lived for as a kid.,44 Adamson Crescent Cooktown VIC 2038
This is a good superheroes film but it can be an excellent movie if they removed the time travel element/plot from the movie. Time travel plot has been used so many times in entertainment media now it becomes so tiring to watch. I appreciated the effort to realize this epic 'masterpiece' but I can't give an excellent score to a film with cheap plot.,45 Abrahams Crescent Yangebup WA 2145

"I love marvel cinema universe, I watched all the films. I can say that 3 hours is enough for the film to contain both the epic, and the plot, and everything possible. The film is very boring at the beginning, I understand that it must be sad at the beginning, but not as tedious. The middle is even less intrinsic, but still far from the most interesting. I would give the film 6 points, but the final battle is fantastic. I have not seen such a battle in more than one film. It was probably the most epic that I saw. Therefore, since I love marvel, and for the epic battle at the end, I put 8 points. 10 points film does not deserve.",65 Academy Close Oakden VIC 4270
"A well made film that is marked as the ending for the MCUThe film was exciting and funny, not as well written as Infinity War but easily a top ten superhero movie.

Honestly, it was way too long & boring, I ended up not caring what happened in the end.  I kept thinking what excuse are they going to use this time to delay Thanos's eventual death.  Too many plot holes, farfetched and every excuse in the book to show case every character in the Marvel universe.  I was so glad when it was over.",65 Abercrombie Circuit Moorabbin  
"The continuation of the war of infinity. the film is very cool! The unexpected death of Thanos at the beginning, 5 years later, fat Thor, Bruce and Hulk in one body, traveling during the time, clicking the Hulk, this is something with something.

This movie is so amazing as it is but i hear rumours about the extended versions with some cut scenes which would have been amazing in the movie. But amazing wish it was 4 hours,22 Adkinson Close Wellington Point VIC 2260
"You got to be kidding me. You call that the best conclusion for all the marvel films since Iron Man. That was the most boring movie ever. Come on, time travel. That was the stupidest climax of this Movie. If you want to make this movie great about time travel then you got to be logical which place and time to be than other random time and place to receive something important. If they want to go timeTravel to get the stones and if Banner told them If he change something in the past won’t change the future, then why didn’t they get the stones  when Thor injury Thanos in Wakanda battle and all the characters just take the gauntlet with the stones and bring to the Future. That would have make much easier instead going to different timelines to get the stones individually and Black Widow could have been alive. The first half was so boring to do timeHeist. So overall, let’s pretend this movie never happen and use my own creation for this movie without time travel and continue with the other future marvel movies. I’m was pissed of on this movie.",14 Abrahams Crescent Salisbury East NSW 6280
"A great finale to an amazing series, however, due to several plot holes, and obvious ways the could’ve defeated Thanos, too many things seemed unrealistic, the action was great, but was yet another disposable CGI army, Thanos seemed unrealistically more powerful, Iron Man’s death seemed avoidable, they had the time stone and somehow they couldn’t undo Iron Man’s death? Boring at times, too long, it faield to get me interested in the next movies (besides Far From Home) but a solid conclusion.",434 Ackland Place Goonellabah NSW 3551
"Marvel fans, you have to come to the realization that these movies are not that great. In particular the humor. The  humor in the MCU has gotten horrible and always seems to show up when you would be experiencing something other than laughter (""I aimed for the head""). This is the primary reason I don't consider these movies to have any heart put behind them. I firmly believe that they follow a formula where there has to be a joke after a certain amount of time regardless if it kills the mood.On the  bright side, at least Thanos' goal made sense in this movie. The killing half the universe thing is stupid if you still allow what is left to reproduce, and since he had the kill set to randomize you were always going to have about a 50/50 split on the sexes. Thor, just why? He has been a pointless laughing stock since Ragnarok. Hulk was also a disappointment. If the comics are anything to go by, people in general don't like a fusion of Banner and Hulk, and generally it seemed it only existed due to the special limitation that they put into the Infinity Guantlet (which shouldn't have limitations and makes no sense to have any if Thanos was going to do with it in this movie what he wanted). If it wasn't for Downey and Thanos this time I would probably rate this movie a zero.",85 Academy Close Kinross  5157

"This is an amazing film. I love almost every aspect of this film. As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Before I get started, here is a spoiler warning. Go see Avengers: Endgame and then come back. Let’s get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn’t like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn’t affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn’t work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it’s understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It’s sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it’s serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn’t anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn’t know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say “I am Iron Man” one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven’t seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion. I give Avengers: Endgame a 9.5/10.",1 A'beckett Street Thornlie VIC 6230
"Avengers Endgame is one of the very few movies that I can watch over and over again based on it's amazing story, humor and action. The final battle is the best final battle against a villain that I have seen ever. 9/10 for me.",10 Ada Place Dunnstown NSW 3129
"In a word ""Boring"". What a waste of time! this movie shows all the superheros in their old fragile state and then they eventually die. Everybody is crying, being sad, depressed and dramatic for almost 3 hours. By no means anybody can tell that this is an action movie.Thor was humiliated beyond any tolerable limits. Marvel has Faded all the actor's powers (HULK,THOR) and killed few(IRON MAN, Captain America, Black widow) and humiliated others (THOR). Its definitely not exciting to see captain america swinging Thor's hammer.When they get back in time to save the world they made the movie worst. This time travel thing is used when movie makers can't form a proper story. Overall, this was the worst Marvel movie ever made. Never watch this director's & writer's movie ever again. I know i won't.",40 Adamson Crescent Wangaratta WA 2650
"Very bad Thanos. Thanos was the very nice character in the infinity war. he was with the motivation  (the inhabitants of his land were killed) and he wanted to kill half of the entire universe, but in the endgame he just wanted to destroy the planet just because he is",50 Abercrombie Circuit Mount Eliza NSW 5540
"Never felt like I could roll my eyes so much at such a comedic disaster. Yes the film uses nostalgia to wink at the audience every five minutes but this does nothing but make the film look like just another CGI overhaul fan film that gives its previous instalment (infinty war) little impact. The character deaths were predictable as was the plot, to be honest I had been waiting for iron mans death since five years ago, he's a cool character, but severely overhyped and overused at this point. As I mention the comedy is tragically bad, with every character suddenly pulling terrible jokes out of ""americas ass"" as Ant man puts it. I mean seriously, Thor the God of Thunder is now an overweight drunk playing fortnite?",69 Abercrombie Circuit Ballina NSW 2680
Probably worst movie of MCU. There is nothing making sense about time travel. Dr. Strange only can hold glass of water in this movie. Iron man died for nothing if he just give it those stones to Cap. Marvel hole equation would've solved. But still last battle was awesome and again Thor is a totally disappointing. And what was the Thanos? How can even he be so powerful?,18 Achernar Close Dunsborough VIC 2210

"Avengers Endgame is a great movie. It is a solid end to the past 11 years of great cinematic storytelling. And although I think it is a little bit overrated, I do think it is also worthy of being the closing movie for the current MCU. There is a colossal ensemble of characters that shine in each of the scenes that they are in, there are emotional moments that make you want to cry, there is lots of funny humour and tense action, it has it all. But, it can be a bit messy at points and it does have a few issues with pacing, but on the whole, a great movie and a satisfying conclusion.",79 Absolon Place East Fremantle SA 7054

Pretty boring compared to infinity war. Missing some of the best characters and overall unsatisfying,7 Abercorn Crescent Hawthorne QLD 6071
The movie is based on nonsense. I believe if one superhero can save the world then 10 of them would easily destroy thanos. So it's so stupid that these superheroes can't kill thanos.

Disappointing. The build up was slow and even got boring at times. The movie was enjoyable but not great. Not sure what others found great in this movie. Definitely not my favourite avengers movie,74 Abbott Street Kellyville NSW 2611
"Avengers: Endgame. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. It takes you through a emotional rollercoaster with references sprinkled throughout, bringing you back to where it all began but has a few moments which make it just short of a 10.Captain Marvel was not needed in the movie and served as a ex machina, ruining one of the most epic scene in movie history where earth teams up to defeat thanos and destroys his spaceship in a scene that looked like a reskin of the last jedi which as we know, was not received so well. There were also some inconsistencies throughout the movie with some power scaling problems. An example is Captain America fighting past thanos and getting flung across but was able to handle his infinity gauntlet punch in infinity war? He was also able to summon mjonir because he was worthy, but if he could, why couldn't others? Thor was also seen fat but still was able to fit in his armor and time suit? I understand the material of the time suit might be flexible but armor doesn't have flexibility so we are supposed to assume he just burned fat in a day? Enough of negatives, let's get to the good parts!Throwbacks really caused me to tear up, especially the time travel back to guardians of the galaxy and original avengers as we've known them throughout all these years and movies. Humour was executed greatly in a movie with such a serious tone but worked. Occasionally throwing in jokes helps viewers recover. It is filled with fan service rewarding old fans but not alienating new fans with a simple plot and was sad to see such characters as Captain America go, seeing how they grew but passing on the torch to newcomers to the marvel franchise and I'm looking forward to see what they do next after thanos. We also continue to see the humanity of thanos and him breaking throughout the course of the MCU. We can see that he wanted to eliminate half the universe and when earth revolts, he offers a different solution but the goal stays the same, to let life live in an utopia and achieve peace which is reasonable, and how much he was willing to sacrifice, almost dying to destroy the stones themselves instead of keeping it with him as they served no purpose, showing his humanity and that he cared for people.Endgame also gave finality to the whole series when people started to say that they were the same movies over and over again and although I don't agree, I can see where they're coming from. Just hearing the theme and seeing the avengers team up for one last time was purely amazing and epic with a good ending. Having no end credit or mid credit scene might seem lazy or usual, I believe that that's intentional as they don't want it to be some opener for a bigger movie but an great end to a even greater series.Marvel, I love you 3000. 9/10",7 A'beckett Street Booker Bay VIC 5114
"This movie's plot is half-baked with lots of holes. Not a lot of action scenes, too much backstory about lives of superheroes. Thor did not really play an important part in the movie. Overall, it seems like the movie was a little cash-grab.",55 Abernethy Street Kirrawee NSW 3844
This movie is great it ends all the story lines of the different characters. It packs an emotional punch and i cried my eyes out in the theater. This movies is a great ending to a big franchise.,11 Adam Place Iluka NSW 3174
The hype the made about this movie was huge so I was ready for some treat only to find out that the whole 3 hour (was it?) story could be compacted into 40 minutes.,372 Abercorn Crescent Castlemaine WA 6008
"Avengers:End Game provides an entertaining climax to the current generation of Marvel Super hero films however, like Hawkeye and Black Widow at Vormir, it came pretty close to falling from the cliff and failing the mission in a few places, but thankfully crisp (not rushed) pacing provided a life-line whenever we were staring into the abyss.We begin with a continuation of the gloom cast by the end of Infinity War, and are invited to a heartbreaking picnic with Hawkeye, this scene is played well; not overdone. It is sad and reminds us of what has been at stake, and the recent defeat of the Avengers. It sets the tone for the film nicely; we are going to have to confront the emotional debris left in Thanos' wake over the course of the next few hours. We settle in for the ride.The only problem with the picnic scene is it happens during the day, while over in Wakanda...presumably simultaneously, it was also daytime. I suppose we can just re-imagine Hawkeye's farm was in Africa. But it certainly looks more likely a good scene was developed and shot without much thought going on regarding the time-line of events. Which is strange, because as the film goes on. Time becomes a central issue.Stark is rescued,avoiding certain death twice in the space of a few days now...he returns bitter and damaged, as are all our heroes. We go after Thanos then take a break for 5 years.Thor is suffering PTSD. As a big fan of The Big Lewbowski,I enjoyed his transformation here, but had some horrible Luke Skywalker flashbacks, which I think are the main trigger from some of the outrage on-line at this decision. I think it works here, because Marvel has always had a comedic element. Thor had a compelling reason to be in the state he was in, and the writers allow us to see him rise from the ashes of himself again as the final battle looms.Once the time travel story begins, we came close to the fall. The constant referencing of films (as with Spiderman in Infinity war referencing the Alien franchise) and revisiting scenes from previous films seemed to bog the story down. Rather than making me feel connected to these characters because of their familiarity with the actual world, I felt pulled out of the fantasy...the effect was to break the fourth wall and rather than finding it charming I felt it broke immersion. Despite this being essentially a fun entertainment piece I hate it when immersion gets broken and I'm forced to realize I'm in a room full of people I don't know, (despite the enjoyment of the shared experience of watching a film in a theater),I came here to escape all these people for a few hours. Luckily, the time travel sequences are handled briskly, and are used to set up some nice moments with Captain America (which pays off nicely at the end) the Tony, Mr Stark, Jarvis triangle and then Thor with his mother.My only disappointment with the film is the transformation of Thanos (or regression?).He was a mystery for so long, and then his motivation and cold logic were one of the best things about Infinity War. His personal sacrifice and strength of will to persevere toward his goal, were terrifying and unique. Unfortunately, here we take a turn, and his philosophy is reduced to a simple desire to destroy all life, and remake the world(s) in his own image. Oh...this interesting and complex villain is now just a regular Bad Guy. Let's just all beat each other up now.The climactic fight is spectacular, there is a sense of real peril for most of our heroes and the film manages to keep us on edge. There are a few cringe moments, but again it's a subjective and personal question of taste, little things that don't really damage the film but we could have done without.Captain Marvel again giving us an unwelcome Last Jedi Flashback, flying though Thanos's spaceship in a reflection of the Last Jedi Light-speed ram.In the midst of battle, everything pauses conveniently as a few reunions take place, the whole Grrrl squad moment was a cringe, but thankfully they moved on quickly and didn't make too much of a deal about it.Jump to the final moment of the battle and here comes the coup de grace..'I am....Iron man'. Now that moment was excellent, and was worth sacrificing the Thor 'I went for the head' climax by positioning that as a surprise at the start of the film. We got the best of both worlds there.So in conclusion. A worthy part 2 to Infinity War, which was a very hard act to follow, let alone to try and top. The film looks beautiful, the action sequences are easy to follow and mostly avoid 'shaky cam'. A sad but satisfying end for Iron man; his heroes journey is complete. Having grown from self centered to self sacrificing over the course of the films. Captain America says farewell and his decision was logical and consistent to his desires, and Thor seems a great fit for the Guardians of the Galaxy.I look forward to watching Infinity War and End Game back to back in a marathon someday soon.",61 Adair Street South Melbourne VIC 2580
"Hulk's arc = completed off camera. Thor's ark = we undo the work of the last 3 Thor movies and infinity war. Iron Man's arc = emotional but predictable. Captain America's arc = completely out-of-character and selfish. Black Widow's arc = emotional and powerful, but it was a poor sendoff for a great character. Hawkeye's arc = his Ronan plot was underdeveloped and seemed a bit pointless, but overall his was the most consistent arc of the movie aside from Black Widow's. Overall, this movie was a huge fail, and makes me not want to watch the old films since their plots mean nothing after Endgame destroys them.",19 Abernethy Street Orange NSW 4161
"It's very, very good. Endgame cashes in on all of the great moments and characters of the MCU, and makes a film unlike anything since Return of the King. One complaint is that the film starts stronger than it finishes, Captain America and Black Widow shine in the first act as we see their heart-break over Infinity War. It's incredibly moving watching a regular guy in a support group talk about his first date since Infinity War, and then hearing Cap tell him 'we gotta learn to live, otherwise Thanos should've just killed all of us.' The rest of the film is good, but not quite as moving. My only real gripes are the way that Captain Marvel and the end battle are shoe-horned in, the movie would have been just as good without either.",43 Adinda Street Currumbin Valley VIC 6065
"The best way to describe Endgame is chaotic which is expected when a movie tries to bring together so many characters. However, many sub-plot lines seem shoehorned. Captain Americas demise seemed strange, and really didn't fit the movie. How Iron Man managed to take the stones off of the glove at the end didn't make sense. Captain America coming in and destroying the entire enemy ship as if it were butter, I mean come on, had she shown up 10 minutes sooner there would not have been any fight. That should be a sign of a character that is too OP. Thanos is initially able to throw Captain Marvel aside, then tries again and isn't able to without the power stone. The evil nebula dying without killing a single character. Thanos refusing to finish off any of iron man, thor, or captain america even though he indicated that it was personal now. He literally just stood there for a minute doing nothing until the reinforcements showed up. Thor, captain america, and iron man were unable to defeat thanos without him even having the stones? It seemed like the 3 of them together would've been able to pull it off in infinity war if thanos hadn't had the stones yet. These are just the plot holes I can remember 3 days after watching.The pacing of the movie was herky jerky as well. I was yawning in the theater for the first 45 minutes of the movie. Some parts were just too slow and drawn out. Finally, if you're going to kill off captain america and iron man, they should have killed thor as well to wrap it all up cleanly. Not only that, but let the legacy of the characters end there. Don't pass the captain america shield to his side kick and the role of iron man to tony starks wife and friend.The sound and music was great. The video effects were awesome. I didn't have a problem with most of the jokes or spoken lines. But the plot holes, pacing, and legacies are what subtracted 4 points for me.",164 Abbott Street Lilydale VIC 6728
"The only plus to this movie, and the only reason for score 1 in stead of 0 is ... no, it is 0. The makers of this movie have failed miserably. It is difficult to make such a movie work, with so many characters, but they get an F nonetheless. They could have done a much better job. Let me repeat one thing about superhero movies. They are inherently dumb. The whole premise is just dumb - people with superpowers. But it's a wonderful fantasy - people with superpowers. That's why the creators must put in extra effort to mitigate the dumbness by making the best possible story. Some superhero movies do a better job at that than others. This one does not, and I rank it really low, along with 'Thor - The Dark World' and 'Batman - The Dark Knight Rises'. I shall only mention two things out of many, that make this movie so awful: Thor and Feminism. Let me address both. Thor, one of my favorite characters in Marvel comics and the great Dignitary, has generally been portrayed terribly in the movies - all of them, with the possible exception of Infinity War. First, he's been bland and a spoiled brat in Thor - part one, then he's a stupid, uninteresting oaf through a couple of movies, and then they start introducing clownish aspects to this character, which culminates catastrophically in this movie with fat, drunk, whiny, bum Thor. It is unforgivable. To make things even worse, they don't even let him get in a single blow against Thanos in the final battle. He just gets brutalized by Thanos, and Captain America basically takes over his supposed role, and battles Thanos properly. In the end, they put him with the Guardians of Galaxy. Since they are a bunch of clowns, he's should fit right in, but another problem there is that Chris Hemsworth is simply not funny. Maybe he could have been very good for the role of Thor, had they written the character properly, but he's no comedian, however hard he may try. I guess some people thought that he was very funny being shocked and zapped, he was not.As for the feminism: I like feminism. I also like a good sandwich, but if you shove it violently down my throat, I am going to hate that particular sandwich, and I'm going to hate you. I am talking about that scene during the final battle when ONLY female characters come together to support Captain Marvel in whatever she was trying to do, I don't care. If you desperately want to push societal issues in what is basically a lowbrow superhero movie, you should nonetheless try to make it less painfully obvious and stupid.MCU finale is a total fail. I watched it, many people watched it, you'll watch it, but it is bad.",248 Abercrombie Circuit Lakemba NSW 2292
"Thirty years ago, the critical and financial flop Howard the Duck was among the only comic book features from Stan Lee’s imagination. Then twenty years later, it took a total reversal to the capacity when Marvel has mastered the art of brainwashing people into numbly thinking their products, including their newest one, Avengers: Endgame, lands among the greatest Hollywood productions ever (just look at IMDb’s top 250 for crying out loud). But in truth, this is no different than anything else the MCU urinates, and yes, that includes The Incredible Hulk and Thor: The Dark World.The time travel genre of this finale to phase three explains plot holes by mocking similar movies, yet still winds up far more illogical than Back to the Future, The Terminator, Hot Tub Time Machine 2, and all others of such. The random sequence arrangement between the multiple heroes who jump through multiple places in time turns tedious, but not nearly as tedious as when they explain then re-explain stuff through massive information dumps that continue even after the climax. The atrocious script confuses the average viewer beyond wanting to care as it shoves aside an important character death two-thirds of the way through to make extra time for awkward jokes and boring exposition.The first joke happens in a very serious conversation where multiple lives are discussed as being at stake, then bam: Tony insults Rocket with intention to generate a chuckle. Among the more awkward jokes thrown around includes one of how nobody knows who Ant-Man is while everybody knows who the Hulk is. Except that joke doesn’t really work, not only because it has nothing to do with the plot, but mostly because everybody on earth now knows Ant-Man. This imbalance between drama and comedy is just chaos unworthy of celebration, which can’t even carry any intelligence throughout a sentimental San Francisco memorial for the Snap victims.Anyone deeply committed to the series could mostly likely by now be terribly sick of the cut-a-second editing and nauseating handheld camera, which here gets so bad it diminishes any impact of the bloated “sudden death” climax. Not to mention there’s drawn out music that never changes its style—a heavily American score that makes the already racist depiction of a Japanese assassin much more unacceptable. The music can’t even make a smooth transition between scenes, not that there could be one to start with, most of the “sad scenes” transition to upbeat scenes on a dime… at least Captain America 1990 stayed consistently cheesy.Out of complete fairness though, the problems of humanity start things off in this production as best as they can. It starts when Hawkeye’s daughter vanishes after an archery lesson, then develops it further as it shows how the dark fate of Tony seems to be booked, until Captain Marvel saves him. She’s in here for only a total of about two minutes, but Brie Larson has improved her horrendous performance from the last movie, which is enough to make the first two scenes of this movie relatively effective.In fact, all of the actors are better than before thanks to the more heartful attempts against urgent problems this studio wants to comment on. Mark Ruffalo is now at his funniest based off how high his character rises, as is Chris Hemsworth, based off how low his character drops. It’s like they both accepted the fact that they’re stuck in a skittles-level narrative, and it only took them eight years to finally make the most of it without phoning in their performances! That little motivation the Russo brothers express uplifts the somewhat brilliant comedic effect when watching clever flashbacks to previous movies, which triggers effective tension.Don’t be fooled though, those behind this production still willfully deny whatever trouble they caused, particularly in how much they dishonor our own spirituality. It’s easy to neglect the individuals within this three-hour blitz, considering they are impossible to count by now. Because Disney isn’t even trying to tell an actual story, Thanos‘ complexity disappears from his last appearance. The heroes honestly showed more layers of opinion and conflict without a villain, much like in one of the MCU’s finer films, Captain America: Civil War, it would be better to return to that level of risk-taking instead of this blatant fanservice.Geez, the deeper I review such a popular insult to art like Avengers: Endgame, the angrier I become about what some choose for fulfillment! It’s recommended not to support writers who crank out a billion dollars without even trying. Eventually their true colors will show, and ultimately reveal the wrong in giving up money to Mickey Mouse. If “you are what you watch” is true, then wasting three hours here will give the effect of a trash heap on those who worship the red logo.",36 Adamson Crescent Coolbellup WA 3429
"Truly an absolute masterpiece and breath taking superhero movie like no other! A magnificent journey down memory lane and a bitter sweet conclusion and farewell to some of our favorite heroes and characters. This movie ultimately sums up everything the MCU built up the past 11 years and 21 films, but still leaves more to look forward to even if it feels like the end. Truly a must see cinematic experience like no other! It will make you cry, laugh, wow, and feel, all your emotions will just pour out!",1 A'beckett Street Hillside ACT 4221
"It's the hype that kills you.......after Marvel took some brave risks with IW which gave provided the film with substance and emotional gravitas, they directors, unsurprisingly, chose to unwind all of that and essentially, with the exception of the death of Iron Man, return everything to the status quo (yawn). The most interesting character from IW was Thanos, who, rarely for a Marvel villain, had a clear motive and was an emotionally complex character whose obsession with his own destiny destroyed everything he loved, in the name of 'saving' the universe. Interesting stuff. So do the writers do? they kill him off in the first few minutes, only to bring him back via time travel, which results in the Thanos of this film becoming another caricature of a villain; this Thanos has not been through the Trauma of sacrificing his own daughter, or through the hard graft of travelling across the galaxy to acquire the infinity stones. He's just another over-powered villain here. They should have found a more creative way to make the 'original' Thanos a viable threat, which would have forced the writers to come up with a more imaginative way of tackling Thanos for the second time, instead of using brute force in (another) final battle sequence. The humour was pitched at just the right level in IW, there's even more of it here and as such the film is tonally confused and feels more like Thor:Ragnarok than a sequel to IW. Captain Marvel is also grossly underused, especially after the not-so-subtle hint and the end of that film that she was going to play a part in Endgame. The time travel plot is incredibly inelegant and I'm still not sure on the logic that it doesn't really matter what you do in the past because it won't affect the future anyway? It was a device solely used to revisit some of the old Marvel movies, which is shameless fan service but I'm not necessarily against fan service and I'm sure it was a fun nostalgia trip for a lot of people. The filmmakers also do not really explore what life is like on Earth post Thanos' eradication of half of life on the planet - yes it's quieter and people are still sad, but there was a real chance to explore some interesting questions as to whether there was any (admittedly brutal) sense in what Thanos was trying to achieve (there is a moment where Cap comments that a pod of dolphins were seen because the rivers are less polluted due to less human traffic, but that is quickly quashed). However I appreciate most Marvel fans are not paying to see an intelligent comment on the problem of overpopulation. So what does this all add up to? an average Marvel movie where there are no real surprises or deviation from the standard formula. IW was by far a superior film but any sense of venturing into the unknown that IW established was quickly eradicated by a click of the studio's fingers.....",15 A'beckett Street Winmalee NSW 3073
"About the all female scene: as a straight guy, I like that scene. I have seen so many negative comments about it and state the scene is so ""forced"". Well, if we use this mindset, the whole movie is ""forced"" because so many things had to happen at the right place and right time: Tony Stark meeting his father, Steve Rogers getting back with his love of life. Also, if Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Star Lord, Black Panther and Dr. Strange are fighting together in one scene, I don't think people would say it's ""forced"" although they are all males. Last but not least, this whole movie is a fan service. Let's just celebrate the diversity of the superhero lineup. Everyone of them is the favorite for some fans. You don't need to bash others to love one. Thank you!",6 Abbott Street Bayswater NSW 2000
"Thanos finished the world, understandable, but why that long face? Everyone knew from the start that world was going to come back (and with new hair styles) so why spend first 60 minutes being so serious?They followed the formula all 2-part movies do (Kill Bill Vol-1/2, Harry Potter and Deathly Hollow 1/ 2) where first part is all about action and next one a lot drama with action in the end. Lesser known avengers could sue Thanos for discrimination as he left most famous Avengers to undo what he had done. But in the same way, Thanos can sue Disney and Marvel for strategically delaying Captain Marvel Movie Hence Captain Marvel was kind of immune to the disintegration phenomenon. Not only that but every single Avenger was saved with no serious injury in a massive missile attack by Thanos just before the final better. So was Antman who was in Quantam Realm, strangely 5 years were only 5 hours to him, but not to the Wasp who stayed there for some 30 years but aged 300 years which should have been 30 hours only.Logic behind saving the world was so grossly cliché and confusing that most of the time it was hard to catch up. Introduction of time machine and promise to not engage with past selves or play with the thread of time was so lame. Eventually they had to come up with the most stupid reasons to fill up the black holes they created in their stories. Like previous movie, End game has infinite stares. In an action packed movie where every response is predicted, a serious focus on a character and his dense stare feels awkward. Infused drama about every character, we know how much everyone thrives for science yet they refuse in the start to only come up with the solution in snap of a finger. Be it Bruce Banner or Tony Stark. Greatest science inventions like time machine are shown to be as easy as boiling eggs. Time travel not only revives dead and disintegrated characters but makes avengers even more strong. I wondered if they thought to go back in time and fix 9/11.Since writers were extremely lazy while developing the idea for the movie and could not weave in all the events in the past with their retrospective effects, they brought in an alternate reality approach so that they could mess up other realities to save the one they are in. And avengers in other realities are so lazy and sacrificing that they didn’t lift a finger to save their realities because Disney was not making movie about their reality.Character profile and development is perhaps strongest if we minus the excessive drama. Tony and Captain get the strongest storyline. Natasha’s departure and response by rest of avengers was perhaps forced into the story. All these years and no one knew if she had a family? What kind of friendship they have? Finally, the most commercial idea of passing Captain America’s shield (franchise torch) to someone colored. There was a Wonder Woman moment when all females assembled to secure Captain Marvel’s trip to time machine. Special effects are nothing new and same goes for the weird creatures.End Game might try to invoke that feeling which you have when a very long series end but it infuses more drama and action it actually needed and the ending in every possible way was predictable and weak.",431 Abercrombie Circuit Winston Hills NSW 6566
"In itself the movie is really good and the final is very satisfactory. However, the time travels and the fantasy that result with other realities, leaves many holes in the movie. Despite that, shutting down the brain won't be so hard after all, there are emotions and mixed feelings that mitigate the field of science fiction that the Avengers entered.",53 Abbott Street Eaglehawk  5433
"A movie that seems like 3 movies fused: A part about regret and defeat, a part about a time heist and another that is the great battle we've all been waiting for.The humor is hit or miss, with some jokes being repeated too many times (Fat Thor). The time travel part creates a huge amount of plotholes, but it's interesting indeed.The movie lends too much time for the first part, filling much of the 3 hours of the movie. The main characters on this movie are the original avengers, whose story ends in this movie. The best part about this movie is how it ties up all the storylines of the MCU in a satisfying conclusion.It is a worse movie than Infinity War but it definitely isn't a disappointment. However it gives me the idea that the future of the MCU won't be that great, seeing as the most important Avengers in the next phase are mostly absent (I still don't see Captain Marvel as the leader of the New Avengers, it is still an undeveloped character).Hawkeye/Ronin's storyline is compelling and Scarlett Johansson works the best as Black Widow in this movie, although her sacrifice scene is a bit odd.The final battle against Thanos is compelling although being time travel Thanos makes it less dramatic. The battle between Thanos and Scarlet Witch could have been more emotional with a Thanos that killed Vision.Tony Stark's sacrifice is compelling as the end of Stark's character development, becoming a symbol for the hope of humanity and the Avengers. From being an arrogant and egotistical man to a selfless yet still arrogant hero, fighting for the future.",13 Adcock Place Murray Bridge VIC 2648
"I won't get into too many details since this movie has been reviewed a zillion times already.  It was a nice conclusion to the series, it checked off all the boxes, all the Marvel franchise characters got their moment, even though some were featured more than others, and it had a bittersweet and poignant ending  Was it great?  No, for me it was just very good.  There weren't any really suspenseful moments where I was thinking, oh my God, how will they get out of this one?!  Everything played out very predictably, and because they had to cram so much into three hours, the story was always rushing to the next thing before you could finish digesting the last thing.  Lots of great humor though, a final cameo by the late great Stan Lee, a beer belly Thor, CGI Michael Douglas from 1970, and some very touching moments, particularly with Stark and Hawkeye in scenes with their loved ones.  Captain America's epilogue was also very sweet.  The big battle near the end was visually spectacular, but as with many big special effects battles, just way too busy to make sense out of most of what's happening. Sensory overload.  And it was over almost as soon as it started.  Still, Endgame is a solid and worthwhile finish to the series, while not entirely amazing as a standalone film.",8 Abercrombie Circuit Calista VIC 2640
"Not even close to being on Infinity War's level.  I went to a late show and nearly dozed off a dozen or so times.  I had to struggle to stay awake for the first 2 hours, literally.  It was that boring.  Also a ton of plot holes in this film.  Out of the 50% of everything that Thanos destroyed in the previous film, Ant-man is the only one to return in the beginning, because of some time travel quantum physics thing that is poorly explained, in which Iron Man discovers how to create time travel and isn't explained how, whatsoever.  He just magically creates it in his home with Pepper Pots.  Then there's the fact that Thor is a laughable and pathetic, depressed drunk who makes no contribution at all, and Banner Hulk is just awful.  Go into this film expecting a lot of boring nothingness for the first 90 minutes and you will find it maybe enjoyable.  Now the reason I give it a solid 7 after all this complaining, is that the final act of the movie is very engaging and enjoyable at least.  The action in the Avengers films is always great, and even though this final chapter had very little action until the end, it was good enough to make the film overall GOOD.  Just don't expect anything like the greatness that was Infinity War.",245 Abercrombie Circuit Highton VIC 2380
"First of all, let me state the fact that whoever embraces time travel in movie/TV/video game plots, needs to up his standards. It is one of the laziest and most uninspiring attempts to create stories around and usually ends up in not making any sense (just like in this movie).As for the film itself, it started great by showing everyone's pain and anger towards Thanos, but from the moment that mouse(lol) happens to press a button and create this whole ""time travel"" plot, everything goes to absolute **** And it's not just the time traveling, it's also the disrespect shown to characters like The Hulk and Thor, as well as the Shonen anime type of ass pulls like Captain America fighting with Thor's hammer and summoning lightnings from the sky. Moving on to Thanos.. He was there, but he wasn't really. The villain that Infinity War built is not there and even worse, he goes out of character claiming to destroy the Universe and how he will enjoy torturing Earth. Last but not least, the typical feministic cringy bull****.. Captain Marvel has the gauntless and the only ones running to protect her are the female Avengers? All my **** lolz at that scene.This movie took a huge **** on what Infinity War had built and scrapped everything that made it great. Sadly, we live in an age where people have low standards and get manipulated by heavy marketing so I expect this movie to be considered a ""success"".",114 Abernethy Street Moss Vale QLD 4520
The worst work that has been done by Marvel. If you want to waste 2.20 hours for dialogs and only ~ 40 minutes to see the fight that doesn't cost it.,42 Adamson Crescent Granville  3136

"Utterly pointless movie. Replace the last ten minutes of IW with the last ten minutes of Endgame, and you have everything of note in a single movie. Unfortunately a big step back from Infinity War. IF offered an epic plot with the fantastic worlds, that was made great by great characters. EG is emotional and character-based drama. The only problem is, emotions and characters are where EG fails. It is hard to believe those two movies were made by the same people. Bad script, bad direction, bad pretty much everything. Scenes and emotions flow without any regard to each other, scenes of sadness, abruptly replaced by comical ones. A lot of scenes that serve no particular purpose, other than cheap and stupid jokes in what is supposed to be a tragical/drama movie. Or vain effort to convey emotions or shoehorn something in. A man that is able to build a fusion reactor in a cave has to wait for a space taxi? Or that Hawkey/Widow thing. Why is Hawkeye willing to exchange his whole family for Widow? Survivor guilt, yeah, but other than that, why does he want to jump off that cliff? His haircut?Character-wise, I am of course not talking about Brian ""Deus Ex"" Larson, who is just a bad actress playing a bad character in bad scenes. I mean, it is almost funny, she is so OP they have to figure out how to keep her out of the story, because otherwise she would not only marginalise every other hero, but the whole story as well. So bad.Or Black Widow, cold-blooded killer who for some strange reason had a nervous breakdown and now rules the universe while surviving on peanut butter sandwiches. No jelly, that is how serious it is. And the movie is full of such silly and naive scenes one would expect from a college director. Well, it is about time travel after all, but still.It is the disgrace called Thor. Ragnarok/Infinity War completed his awesome story arc, he finished his journey, becomes the high king of the nine worlds (or something).In Infinity War, he had one purpose. To avenge his people and his family. But no! Turns out those 6 movies was not what Thor really wanted. All he really wanted was to tour the universe in a space ship!So instead of leading his people in moments of their greatest needs, he passes the throne onto a traitor and coward and run away to bully a man who lost his mother when he was 5, brought up by pirates and had to kill his own godlike father. Some people find that funny. I guess he was too awesome even for the WOMON POWA, so he had to go. WTF? Thanos Hitlerised into just an another egotistical maniac. Yeah, the reason why IF was so great? An actual antagonist! Constant bullying of Ant-Man was not that funny either. The more I think about it, Endgame is the new low for Marvel Universe. (Not counting Captain Marvel, I mean...) Age of Ultron, Guardians of the Galaxy 2 style. Yes, Age of Ultron. I will have to think twice before seeing a Marvel again. The story direction is  completely wrong.",47 Abercorn Crescent Ulverstone NSW 3672
"Worst Avengers movie ever - Capt Marvel does nothing. Why the hype to release her origin story two months before? Seriously, build up a sequence of 21 films for this terrible end movie????",43 Adinda Street Toowoomba QLD 2761
"Avengers Endgame is the most jaw dropping movie I have ever seen. Not only because of what unfolds but really because of how it unfolds. It's not only ambitious, it has so much heart that people that haven't even connected to these characters might shed a tear over their hardships. Tony Stark was great as always, the Hulk became as likeable as ever, Black Widow shocked me, and Captain America did good. I think a real standout is Captain Marvel though. Her power was so brute that it gave me goosebumps but her vulnerability shined through and made me emotionally involved with what she was doing. Thor though... Overall I thought this movie was really worth the decade wait.",19 Adair Street Parkinson VIC 3496
"Had to check my watch during the first 2 hours, not because of a lack of action, heck, most of my favorite movies have zero or near zero action in them, but because it was just a yawn inducing cringing fest. And the last hour was just as cringy.I'm done with the Marvel/Superheros ""grandiose"" movies I guess. Only Marvel movies I'll watch going forward will probably be the Doctor Strange ones.",7 Adcock Place Cooroy NSW 2484
"The long-awaited conclusion of the storyline started in Iron-Man 11 years ago. Looking at it like that its easily an 8/10, super satisfying for a fan like me and has a lot of moments that you will cry, clap and laugh. Although I believe the comedy could have been handled better, the movie doesn't focus on it as much as the other elements. You shouldn't look at this movie as a regular movie, you should look at it as the conclusion and if you haven't been following this universe this movie won't make sense, and won't hit you as hard. Overall 8/10",8 Adkinson Close Birkdale NSW 2913
"After the mind-blowingly stellar and near perfect Avengers: Infinity Wars, I went to see Avengers: EndGame and was severely disappointed. Despite an admirable performance by Robert Downey Jr, the rest of this trainwreck is easily the worst Marvel movie made in years. Horrid pacing and a non-existent script and the most cringe-worthy performance outshine the admittedly fantastic CGI and strong choreography. It goes to show that a movie even with triple AAA CGI and special effects will fall flat on its face without a coherent and strong script. The Hulk is made into an absolute joke in EndGame, and Thanos motivations are little different from the prequel, except worse. Chris Hemsworth's performance as an Alcoholic Thor destroys what little hope was left for this movie. To say Hemsworth's performance was cringe-worthy doesn't do the experience any justice. Outside of Robert Downey Jr, most of the actors felt flat and uninspired in Endgame. Little is different about the plot from Infinity War, except that Infinity War had a dark twist ending and compellingly developed the antagonist as a villain. In Endgame, Thanos just feels like a substandard cliche, ""I want to take over the world"" stereotype. Despite the phenomenal battle scenes and choreography, the robotic and lifeless performance from the rest of the cast, not to mention aggravatingly horrible jokes and cliches riddled throughout the picture destroy all credibility this film could have had. Its as if the film directors and screenwriters looked at all the elements that were prodigious about Infinity War and said to themselves, ""Who needs ANY of that when we can have cliches?""    Avengers: Infinity War is without a doubt the superior film, and Marvel would be wise to revisit its strongest aspects to improve on the sequel.",5 Abernethy Street Ingleburn QLD 4350
"Avengers: Endgame starts off in a situation we don't often see in superhero movies; the heroes have lost. Thanos has successfully erased half of all life. When the Avengers discover that he has destroyed the Infinity Stones to prevent them from being used again, they eventually decide to do some time travel to get past versions of the stones in an attempt to revive everyone that disappeared.This is a film that rewards you if you've seen several past MCU films, with events of said films going on in the background as the Avengers and their allies search for the stones. The action's great, there are emotional stakes, and the humour generally hits. The directions taken with Banner/Hulk and Thor will probably rub some the wrong way, but this is ultimately a great conclusion to the ""Infinity Saga"". I can't wait to see where the MCU is taken next.",31 Acraman Place Tuggerah VIC 2903
"Whoa, just wow, what a movie. In 3 hours of plot, character, incredible action, mind blowing CGI and real emotional scenes, Avengers: Endgame does not cease to stride above the rest of the MCU. A film that brings viewers back in time and allows the viewers to think about how much the MCU has given us. Very contemplative storytelling is blended with great humour and mythic battle sequences to create Endgame! After (I think) Infinity War failed at managing film with lots of characters, Endgame does not.The characters each are represented with a realistic perspective. Their weaknesses are shown to the viewers. And finally the stars are allowed to act. Hollywood’s most famous actors step it up in Endgame and deliver heartfelt emotional scenes and moments without anything tying them down. The best part for me was how Endgame felt like reading a comic book, the action, the plot, the characters. Even some sequences felt like they were drawn by Stan Lee. But as with any film Endgame has problems but minor problems. First, Thanos could have been defeated much quicker. Some characters were glazed over and forgotten about. Finally, the Avengers could have made better choices. There were ways, easy ways, they could have accomplished their tasks. Some of the things they did were stupid. All of these are minor problems. Avengers: Endgame is by far my favourite Avengers film.",22 Adamson Crescent Jambin WA 2036
"I would have given it a 9 or a 10 if it were not for the feminist agenda. There were plenty of scenes showing strong capable women throughout the film and I loved them. what I did not love, was the power puff girls scene at the end.",13 Abercorn Crescent Unanderra VIC 2710
"One word: ok.First of all, I don't think I've ever seen such a cheap victory for the good guys. Without going into details, the best word I can think of is ""lame"". Thanos seemed like the one that fought the hardest and won because he was the strongest, until the Avengers cheated, and I'm not even talking about the time travel that they invented on the fly. People that saw the movie know what I'm talking about.What the **** was Gamora's motivation? The amount of **** the movie needs to pull so that the Avengers can win is fanfiction worthy.Then there is this grl powah the movies are trying to pull. Here is how you know you're being sexist: invert the genders and if you cringe, you are being sexist. What the hell did they do to Thor? How would that have looked like if they pulled that with Carol?. Why is it funny funny that Gamora did that to Peter? He didn't know it was another Gamora. For ****s sake. It's childish and unnecessary.The good thing is that for every stupid crap the movies pulls, it has something great or heartwarming too. What a great goodbye this movie was. Just not on the same level as Infinity War. But a good watch.",38 Abernethy Street Bassendean NSW 6157
"Very disappointing vs. the great Infinity Wars. What happened to all the witty dialogue? The writing was just plain poor this time around. It felt like the writers were lazy and took the audience for granted. Cheap fat jokes just don't cut it in this movie. Instead of the joy we felt watching Infinity Wars (and the first Avengers movie), we felt one big ""meh"" after watching this one. With very few exceptions, the interesting character interplay and humor that was present in Infinity Wars was absent in this one. It's frustrating to see this movie getting such great reviews from ""professional"" reviewers. With all the money spent and made with these films, couldn't they hire good writers?",31 Absolon Place Eastwood NSW 2220
"I thought ‘Avengers: Endgame’ was a great movie, but not without its flaws. It’s deeply satisfying and very entertaining in a lot of ways. The themes of depression and loss are handled very well, and they allow the heroes to feel the most human they’ve felt in a long time.As the conclusion to the twenty two movie and eleven year long ‘Infinity Saga’, it’s pretty much perfect. As a stand alone movie (connection to other Marvel movies aside), it’s good, not great. While there are some glaring plot holes that do ruin a few aspects of the movie, I can forgive most of them. The pros out way the cons here, but the cons are definitely there. I had such a good time watching the movie that I didn’t even notice most of the plot holes (not to say there are a lot) on my first or second viewing, they were pointed out to me in other reviews. Here’s the bottom line, it’s very enjoyable to watch, but the second you apply any kind of logic (including rules they established in this movie) to a lot of the plot points, it begins to crumble, but, it gives some characters satisfying endings and others a bright future.I once said that after ‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’, I would stop watching most Marvel movies, but after this, I think I’ll stick around for a little while.Also, f*ck Captain Marvel, she ruined moments that otherwise would’ve been amazing.",19 Abernethy Street Donnybrook VIC 2800
"I found the first 75% of this movie to be some of the best and most poignant writing in the Marvel movies.  While some might have found it slow, I found it emotionally deep.However, it kinda felt like, near the end, that they abandoned the plot and just said ""Let's have a giant, epic battle"".And it really doesn't matter that they define their ""time travel"" as ""not Back to the Future"" because they ultimately disregard their own rules on time travel anyway.No matter how you turn it or look at it, one way or the other, their actions at the end of the movie don't make sense.Either what you do in the past is important, or it's not.  It creates alternate timelines, or it doesn't.  You just can't have it both ways.So while I liked the first 3/4 of the movie, the ending was just the same old Hollywood tripe meant to appeal to certain kinds of people.And I guess, looking at the reviews:  they succeeded there.",23 A'beckett Street Charlestown NSW 6021

"This movie had it all. I don't think it is any better than Infinity War but I don't think the two should even be compared. It's really a 7 hour movie, or a 7-episode final season of a TV series. What a way to end it.",26 Abbott Close Smithfield VIC 3150
"Infinity War was a wonderful epic film yet this doesn't feel like it is written or directed by the same people.They 'cleansed' Thor and Hulk of their toxic masculinity making them literally laughing stocks. From IW when Thor had an amazing journey, he is just embarrassing in this. And Hulk whose MO is losing his **** and smashing things up is suddenly all touchy feely - what the hell. It's almost like there is some kind of agenda in needing to clip the wings of the old guard before the next phase.The time travel feels silly and gimmicky and nothing more than self indulgent fan service. They effectively ape IW by having the Avengers go on a stone search just like Thanos did in IW. It makes scenes such as that on Vormire have little or no tension because we saw it all in the other film.Tony and Steve's arc doesn't get any decent closure with Tony reverting to the self absorbed douche bag that he was when the series started and Steve being his effective verbal whipping boy. All the efforts to make Thanos engaging and empathetic are cast aside so that the journey we saw him go on in IW is just thrown in the trash and we are given the 2014 Thanos who is just a cardboard cut out evil bad guy. This isn't the guy that we saw in IW who made the sacrifice on Vormire and could empathise with Scarlet Witch.For no reason whatsoever, he has decided against his life goal of a 50% cull of the universe to complete annihilation of everything even though he hasn't had the opportunity to experience the 'fruits' of his cull. He is also now ridiculously over powered. In IW, Stormbreaker nearly kills Thanos when he has all six stones yet in Endgame, he has no stones or gauntlet and Thor can't mortally damage him with Stormbreaker AND Mjolnir.I've seen many try to dismiss these as easily explainable plot holes but the reality is that they are just lazy writing and pretentious directing. Seemingly the makers got themselves into a hole with a fearsome yet sympathetic bad guy, cooked up a time travel device that created nothing but a slew of contradictions, removed the straight line linearity of IW, invested all the money in a final battle that looked like an over inflated DC mess rather than matching the clear and beautifully simple fights/battles from IW and felt the need to hobble some of the biggest characters to signal their social justice virtue.This disappointment of a film which must rank as the Russo's worst MCU film smacks of what happened with Joss Whedon and the Ultron film. Too much pressure and studio meddling , straight jacketed by a dose of political correctness and a loss of stand out creativity to be patched over with fan pleasing guff.Given the Russo's previous stellar work, I expected this to be sure fire hit but what I got was a hot mess of a film that tried to tie things up but rendered itself a little vanilla in doing so. What a wasted opportunity , what a sad end to what had been a glorious 10 years and what a disappointing follow on from the fabulous Infinity War.",61 Adinda Street Atwell NSW 2480

"Thanos is the greatest hero ever if he snapped first trimesters not 4th. Captain Marvel is the worst villain trying to stop him on other worlds. The could have been over in seconds if Iron man ran up and held his hand. Half as long and the movie would be the same. The Superheros powers were did strengths in every scene. How Thor go down after a punch and kick, yet Captain American took several punches w/o being totally crushed!   AI bot written 10 Star reviews and the critics are bought off. Mortal Engines was better.",32 Abbott Close Albury QLD 5342
"After being the 22nd movie in the franchise, it brings the series to new heights. This movie is best benefited by those who have watched most of, if not all of the Marvel films. Throwbacks and characters appear from more than last decade of movies. The acting and comedy is on point with every joke hitting perfectly and every actor showing their passion for the role. The movies set pieces are perfect with sets from past movies. The action, humor and overall story telling shows the passion that not only the Russo brothers had for this film but everyone involved. The story concludes the 22 films perfectly while also leaving character arcs open for future MCU movies. This movie deserves the praise and excites me for future MCU movies in the future. This movie is a roller coaster which can be benefited most by those who have seen many of the other marvel films. Thank you to all those involved in the production of this movie, you have created a great films!",444 Abernethy Street Hackham SA 2460
"ENDGAME definitely succeeds as a celebration of 11 years of the MCU, but didn't quite work for me as a movie in itself.  I certainly didn't hate it, but came away a little nonplussed with the story.  However, a couple of hours afterwards, I decided I was OK with what they did.  Somewhat tellingly, I shed not a single tear... and I am usually an easy mark when it come to ""kicks to the feelz"".  Some great bits. Some bits that felt like they dragged, but overall a triumph in terms of handling a large cast of characters and tying up 11 year old plotlines.",24 Abrahams Crescent Crookwell NSW 6210
"This final...this epic, it is not transferable! This film is a must-see! Spoiler! I still can't get over Tony stark's death!",4 A'beckett Street Geelong West  6751
"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman,  fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.The movie itself  was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from  all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with  achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie.",10 A'beckett Street Moonta VIC 4810
"Avengers Endgame feels like a movie where Marvel is patting itself on the back, good job! I don’t think there’s been a Marvel movie that has disappointed me more than this one. Last year’s Infinity War was great, everything was put together after ten years and it had a fantastic ending, a cliffhanger that had us all wanting more. The dramatic ending in infinity war is completely thrown away. Like my god, every real dramatic moment that was happening in Endgame was thrown away with humor. Literally would it be so bad for people to just be miserable, they toss in these stupid one liner’s in every scene, maybe its just me and I find it forced and not funny, but the obnoxious woman sitting behind me was cackling throughout. But really 5 years into the future the Hulk would still be dabbing? Really? Are people even dabbing now anymore? Captain America admiring his butt, Thor with anything he said, and Black Widow staring into the distance trying to cry for Clint while holding back a smile. Humor shouldn’t be used to take viewers out of uncomfortable situations, what’s the point of a dangerous battle for a viewer when they are constantly molded to feel safe with some joke to kill the seriousness. Let’s talk feminism and the pat on the back. During the big fight scene, they took time out to have all the woman stand together to fight Thanos, I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. Really? That’s showing how progressive marvel is, that shot is an insult considering only one of those women has been a lead in her own film. Marvel pat yourself on the back again, yay Girl Power and your trailblazing feminism.  That moment could’ve been so much better had they fought him and showcased their strengths, showing woman are equally good fighters to their male counterparts. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest super heroes in the whole MCU and she was probably on screen for ten minutes of the 3-hour runtime. But to literally have them come together during this massive fight for that shot is lazy filmmaking. I want one person to tell me they weren’t taken out of the film to consider all the woman were standing together. It killed the momentum in the battle. Risk and reward, Marvel/Disney usually doesn’t do well in this area. Star Wars Episode 8 was fantastic because things were at stake and viewers weren’t just given what they wanted, look at all the complaint they received for it. I really feel episode 9 will be like Endgame in that it gives viewers everything with little to no surprises. Endgame plays everything safe, even when situations are risky they are still safe. You know everything will turn out fine. Yes, there are a few deaths but nothing we weren’t expecting going in. And most of the deaths have already been reversed. Black Widow gets her own series on Disney+. The Characters, in the ten plus years and twenty plus movies, how many characters can you say have grown? Have changed with everything that has happened to them? No character has really felt or dealt with the fallout of anything that has happened to them in previous films. If they have it was for a short period of time because on the other side of the fallout the characters are right back where they started. On a side note with infinity war they finally made Thor cool. With this movie they took ten steps back and made him a dislikable character.I’ve always felt that superhero movies are only as good as their villains. (ex. Dark Knight, Spider man Homecoming) Infinity War made Thanos a great adversary with depth, he had purpose. Endgame made him a caricature of a villain we will forgot about after the credit’s role. That ending and another example of dumbing it down for audiences. The perfect ending would’ve been Steve Rogers going back in time and sitting on the park bench as an old man. Boom! there you go; the audience is smart enough to figure out what happened. Instead they drag the film for some talk between Cap and Falcon. Then they cut to show you where other characters are at and that everything will be okay. Everything is spelled out for the viewers so don’t fret we’re all in a happy place. Like my previous paragraph no one seemed to be affected by everything that happened. I could be wrong, but I guess we will see when the next phase of movies starts rolling out. Now don’t get me wrong there are moments and scenes in this movie I enjoyed. The time travel to the 70s with Cap and Iron man was great. It’s not all bad but the things I dislike are overshadowing the things I liked.The more days I sit with this film the more I dislike it and the hype machine it has become. There’s no substance to anything in this film. When I see people saying this should get nominated for an Oscar, I want people to ponder if they’ll remember anything about this movie in 10 years or even 1 year. In closing here’s one more pat on the back, congrats to the people at Marvel/Disney.",9 A'beckett Street  NSW 5091
"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Great movie, not without its problems, for example Captain Marvel should have been completely wrote out of this movie, she is a character written purely to appease the SJW types who dont even watch these movies, I dread to think what would have happened if she was in it anymore, her whole character takes away the merits the other characters have earned. If they wanted badass woman in this movie then they already have them.Secondly, time travel. While it was fun watching the various characters visit their pasts and revisiting past movies from different perspectives time travel is something that has been done 1000's of times and is not really an original concept, the vast amount of plot holes it leaves are just not worth it. Finally some characters are sidelined for the movies who really shouldn't be I'll let you decide for yourself who you think deserved more time.Overall this is a good movie, if it were up to me I would have done it differently really its only introducing an overpowered character ( Captain Marvel ) and time travel that really let it down, it basically nullifies the past losses and achievements of the movies and its characters as anything they have done can be so easily rectified.I give this movie a 7/10 I am not being too harsh I think this is just right for the movie, I will be 100% watching it again when it comes out of blu-ray.",136 Abbott Street Benowa VIC 3125
"A very fun and fitting conclusion to a wildly successful saga. Its biggest problem is that it relies heavily on time travel, and while they try to explain it, they constantly break their own rules. Banner explained that when you change the past, it becomes your new present and future. And by returning the stones to their original universe, you cauterise that timeline. So why didn't Captain America staying in the past seriously affect the present? And how did he end up on that bench when you need to be stood on that platform to get back? Why did nobody bat an eyelid when Nebula didn't return when Natasha didn't? And Doctor Strange's 1 in 14,000,000 ""plan"" relied on the chance that a rat would release Lang 5 years in the future, and countless other unpredictable variables that they had no control over...To put it bluntly, the writing makes almost no sense. However, it succeeded in completing many character arcs, kept it interesting and creative the whole time and the dialogue exceeded the average Marvel movie. It was also accompanied by some nice direction, whether it was snappy editing for comedy, attractive cinematography for the more emotional scenes or to show the scale of the battlefield, in addition to having impressive production, sound design and visual effects.",42 Abernethy Street Burleigh Heads VIC 5169
"I cannot genuinely give Endgame anything less than a 7/10 rating. The film was good, but it most certainly wasn't better than Infinity War. It's pretty much the Return of the Jedi of the saga. The final battle was entertaining, seeing all the characters brought back was the best, and watching Thanos turn to dust was cool. However, a lot of people are disappointed with what they did to Thor's character; they mindlessly nerfed him. Overweight Thor in the beginning was ok. He wanted to live a normal life, and he felt guilty for failing to defeat Thanos.However, they kept him that way all throughout the entire movie. It was disgraceful. His character digressed with very little payoffs, if any. It wouldn't take long for the God of Thunder to get in shape. He's not an average joe. It's like they purposely kept him that way because they wanted to show the full power and capabilities of Captain America. Thor wanting his revenge on Thanos after failing in Infinity War would have worked, too.As for Captain Marvel, she was barely even in the movie, which is a good thing because fans despise the actress, and yet, she made one of the greatest undeserved impacts on helping to defeat Thanos, while destroying the ship all by herself. Not to mention, the Hulk didn't fight Thanos at all in this film. There are some choices made by the writers that some people don't agree with. If not Thor snapping Thanos away, he should have worked together with Marvel and the Hulk to hold him off, so Tony could later do it.Needless to say, time travel can be so convoluted because no rules are established here.﻿ Wouldn't Nebula killing her other self alter the future? Like what was stated by War Machine, they easily could have gone further back in time to kill Thanos as a baby. However, we wouldn't have had a great film had they chose to do that. There were so many different timelines explored in this movie. If you sit down and think long and hard about it, anyone can pick Act II apart. Furthermore,﻿ they didn't show much of Bucky with Captain America either. The real hero in this film was the mouse for accidentally bringing Ant-Man back. This scene would have been so much more believable had it shown a few homeless people messing around with the equipment. A mouse, really? Iron Man's sacrifice was duly noted along with Black Widow's. The Marvel movies had a fantastic run. For another positive, I liked Iron Man's short interaction with Spiderman. Next, when Capt. America grabbed the mjolnir and fought Thanos. Plus, the writers worked more to give Hawkeye a more in-depth character by showing his family. These were great, memorable scenes. All in all, it's still worth buying on BluRay.",32 Adinda Street Avalon VIC 3165
"TL;DR: Avengers: Endgame is a massive extravaganza film with a lot of enjoyable moments, but without soul, purpose, artistic vision, philosophy or literary value. It's just a big teaser/commercial for upcoming ""products"" by the Disney;Marvel brand.Final verdict: I'm done with the MCU.The Good: -Moments, plenty of memorable moments, plenty of funny moments. It almost feels like the script had the sole challenge of gluing as many cool moments together while marginally providing a way out of the dead end they wrote themselves into with Infinity War's ending.-RDJ delivers a solid performance, without which I think this movie would be unwatchable.-As per usual, visual effects are great, especially with characters that rely heavily on motion capture, and the de-aging tech is becoming scarily good.-In spite of my harsh criticism of this movie's direction (that is still to come), I still think the Russos deserve praise for taking on the monumental task of handling a comic cross-over event.The Bad:-Writing: Bad writing: bad storytelling, bad character arcs, SJW crap breaking the immersion every few minutes, bad dialogue, lazy jokes and a time-traveling plot that doesn't make any sense. And mother of God, plot convenience is the one true hero of this movie. Scott Lang is saved from being trapped in the Quantum realm by plot convenience mouse, Stark figures out time travel by plot convenience AI, Thanos finds out about the avengers' plan by plot convenience cross-time Nebula, and many many other examples.As for SJW crap, Thor and Hulk has been neutered, and Captain Marvel were shoved in this movie without any vision or purpose.-Direction:The direction was weak; The five year gap in the beginning screws up the pacing and is in my opinion a symbol of the triumph of corporate vision over artistic vision. Since there is no discernible effect of the this 5 year gap on the plot, or even most of the story threads. I can only guess this 5 year gap is a corporate device to house spin-off shows and things of this sort. Something we'll just have to wait and see.The pacing of the movie is terrible all throughout. But specifically, the impact of the heist part is totally undercut by the ""past Nebula revealing the plan to Thanos"" crap, this crap was there only to produce the mandatory final showdown, which wasn't very inspired but had some ""cool"" moments, the plot ends about 15 minutes before the end of the movie which is always a problem.In Infinity War, the directors did a good job of juggling the many characters, but in Endgame, not at all. A good example would be that the only thing BP did in this movie was be on screen for a few seconds and say: ""Yibambe""! Add to that the clear SJW motif of neutering Hulk and Thor, and you get a 3 hour movie that neither develops, nor even build upon the development from past movies, of most key characters.",82 Achernar Close Manly Vale NSW 4610
"A little bit of a let down after everything leading up to it. I would have given it a much higher score regardless, if Marvel hadn't put their political agenda's in the film. -They have a scene where they throw in a gay character with absolutely no benefit to the movie, then never seen again. -Then there was Brie Larson at it again. Thank goodness they gave her barely any screen time. Unfortunately that was too much screen time. Every comment she made was condescending, arrogant, and annoying. Terrible Character. Marvel should have definitely used this movie as a way to kill her off from the series. -Then this obsession with empowering all the female characters. In fact they have this one horrible scene where Captain Marvel is trying to get the gauntlet through Thanos' army and only all the female character line up together to protect the gauntlet and back her up. I could totally imagine a ""Girl Power"" banner in the background. I did a face palm in the theater.-Going along with empowering females, they also make the male characters useless. Hulk is worse in this movie then he was Infinity War, except now they also screwed up Thor. Besides Iron Man, Thor was the only other person who deserved to win this. He sacrificed the most, he lost the most, he suffered the most, yet here they make him a fat, alcoholic, useless, and unmotivated character full of insecurities. He didn't get any redemption nor satisfaction, in fact he gave away what he already had (such as the visions and coming in to save the day in Infinity Wars).-The rest of the male characters where all very submissive and weak around the females while the women acted strong and NEVER once showed any weakness.-They ruin this movie with PC cultural and Feminism once again (not sure why they haven't learned from the Captain Marvel flop). I am no longer going to be seeing Marvel movies in the theaters, they are becoming corrupted by this liberal junk. I go to watch movies to enjoy myself. Not to get political correctness and feminism rammed in my face.",543 Adamson Crescent Keysborough VIC 870
"Predictable and boring. Just another superhero movie, nothing like Infinity War which felt like a great action movie, with brilliant plot twists. Bad jokes and three hours of Marvel trying to make every superhero look good and have a good ending.",15 Abercorn Crescent Emu Plains QLD 2800
"Typical time travel plot holes only really effect the ending to a small degree, but the rest of the movie is mostly just fan-service instead of actual plot development.  Many other plot holes ranging from the tiny and momentary, such as Captain Marvel talking in space without comms (no atmosphere, no sound) just like these writers did with Thor in the previous movie, to claiming that the infinity gauntlet cannot do certain things which is oxymoronic, is just more of the same rushed writing we saw from the Russo's in Infinity War.  I particularly liked how nonchalantly the Iron Man glove becomes an infinity gauntlet, because nanites are as good as the magical forge that is driven by a Neutron Star.  But hey, CGI!  Even Rocket's quips were bland and unfunny.  The performances are great, the sound and cinemtatics are great, but the illogical plot points just make this a watch once and forget movie instead of the amazing climax to an era.  This drags down the enjoyment considerably.Without spoiling anything since we know the heros win (Spiderman: Far From Home)- The largest plot hole is what happens to all the people that moved on with their lives?  That ending cannot possibly be considered a good solution.  What about children that had no parents for all that time?  Now add in all the degredation to the world that the Russo's clearly show.  Then factor in that many of these people do not have homes, or bank accounts, or jobs.  The end result is slightly better than the start of the movie, but not by much.  Now the returned have to try to reinegrate... somehow.  But hey, CGI!",79 Abercorn Crescent Mill Park  4560
"Endgame – delivers!  And that is an amazing feat. With more than 50 (!!!) Hollywood stars in one movie and a playing time in the region of 3 hours. This is not your standard superhero flick, no Endgame is more about loss, love, relations, family and just appreciating what you have.I absolutely loved all the funny references to other Marvel movies, and the jokes regarding time travel are hilarious. There are countless references and my favorite is the Coen reference to Thors new appearance.A worthy finale to a journey more than 10 years in the making.Must see if you like Marvel.",103 Abernethy Street Tallebudgera Valley NSW 2536

"""Avengers: Endgame"" is probably one of Marvel's best movies yet. It starts out with Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Nebula stranded in space. He sends out a distress call, and Captain Marvel (Who, I admit, is too overpowered) saves them both. They soon return to Earth, where the remaining Avengers, are there. They later find out that Thanos is using the infinity stones to destroy the tones themselves. After a little talking, Thor, who is angry since half of the universe is dead because he didn't go for the head, has enough of Thanos' voice and abruptly chops off his head. 5 years later, all the Avengers are split up and depressed. Suddenly, though, Ant Man gets released from the quantum realm by accident. He gets excited and tells the Avengers that they can do time travel since the quantum realm is a dimension that can slow or speed up time. He eventually gets all  the Avengers to get the Avengers to come except one. Thor. They travel to New Asgard and find that his home is invaded by a fat, drunk man, who is Thor himself. They eventually convince him to join them by saying ""there's wine on the ship."" Anyways, they fired up the time portal, and off they went. They all succeeded in getting all the stones back, except for Nebula's team. She get's spotted by the 2012 Thanos, Gamora, and Nebula herself from the past. Thanos finds out his future and launches an attack on the Avengers, who have all 6 infinity stones. Eventually, the Avengers snap before Thanos comes. It takes a while, but eventually, Thanos comes. Gamora has small talk with Nebula from the future, and Nebula tells everthing that has happened between 2012 through present day. She stops the Nebula from 2012, who has a desire to impress Thanos, and shoot her. Thanos brings an army of soldiers and ships, who have many more monsters inside, but then all the Avengers that have been snapped away by Thanos in INFINITY WAR come back from the Quantum Realm. They have an epic fight, and the makeshift infinity Gauntlet falls from the hand of Thanos. it becomes like a football game after Peter Parker picks it up and plays keep away. The movie comes to a climatic end when Tony Stark gets the gauntlet and snaps away thanos and his army, which kills him. Then, after Tony's funeral, Captain America puts the stones away. When comes back, he is very old, since while in the quantum realm, he met the love of his life.Overall, this was a really good movie with a lot of juicy details and battles, using the topic of time travel, and having the same old general humor that the Marvel characters have.",90 Abercorn Crescent Corindi VIC 2500
"The second best superhero movie I've see, after infinity war. Takes a while to get going, lots of false finishes and trips to the past, but overall a very fine send off for iron man and captain america. Three hours long, but the time flew by. Marvel are knocking it out of the park at the moment, I can't think of a better way to find escapism at the movies.",55 Abbott Street Bulimba VIC 3305
"Usually the phrase came full circle is used way to often without meaning but in the sense of Avengers: Endgame Marvel did just that, wrapping up 10 years of storytelling and movies all really well.What I really enjoyed about this movie is that it really took its time with the plot, Sometimes it took too long to get going especially with a 3 hour run time but it was never boring and you just kept getting intrigued with the story elements. When the movie starts it’s right off Infinity War and did really well to establish the consequences of the last movie and to let the characters experience the fallout of Infinity War.As I said the movie really took its time with it plot sometimes it just felt a little too dragged on as it left the directors wanted to over-establish some plot points instead of just keeping it simple but I wouldn’t say it’s a major issue it’s just that in a 3 hour runtime you don’t need to over complicate the plot. However though the story was really fantastic, if I haven’t said it before the Russo Brothers are geniuses they managed to wrap up 10 years worth of storytelling in one movie brilliantly from the First IronMan movie till now.Speaking of characters, obliviously there were a lot characters like Infinity War but Endgame was really about the conclusion of the original six Avengers from IronMan, Black Widow, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Thor. Each one had an arc and came to satisfying conclusions by the end of the movie. The really surprising performance came from Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Ronin who we didn’t see on Infinity War and had a really nice story that involved him and his family and the events of Infinity War and how it impacted him. Robert Downey Jr gave the best performance as usual .In all honesty no one gave a bad performance in this movie they all did really well so that’s another plus.Thanos played by Josh Brolin who had a very big role in Infinity War and was a fantastic villain and was one of the best if not the best thing about Infinity War played a small role in Endgame, I mean he was still Thanos he was badass, menacing and obviously had some memorable lines. He wasn’t in the movie all that much except for in the beginning and largely shows up at the end of the movie for the final showdown and that was kinda disappointing, but with the story the Russos went for you could understand why he wasn’t in it that much but still it was kind of disappointing. Thanos was still a great villain in Endgame all that being said and you could fell The after effects he imposed after Infinity War. Without saying too much Thor and Hulk were the twist characters in this movie I mean they did some surprising stuff with them at first I was like Marvel what did you do but in the case of Hulk it turned out all right but Thor...lets just say I didn’t like what they did to him or his arc(if that’s what you wanna call it) was disappointing.The humor was good for the most part of course this is a Marvel movie so forced humor played a factor(sorry if you keep seeing this in all my Marvel review but it is what it is) especially in the case of Thor I mean Endgame didn’t ruin the character of Thor but it’s like they were trying to ruin him if that makes sense. There wasn’t really a lot of action in the first and second half of the movie maybe one action scene in the second act to keep things fast paced, in fact there were like 2 or 3 action scenes in the whole movie(I’ll talk about the final battle just hold on). I mean that was really surprising that a superhero movie managed to keep me intrigued for that much with so little action so again hats off to the Russo’s for a compelling and interesting story. Now let’s talk about the final battle, yes it was Epic I usually don’t describe anything as Epic but the final battle of Endgame was truly a spectacle and I’m glad I got to see it. It was filled with tense moments, awesome comic book action, drama and truly some wonderful surprises, it had it all that I think the final battle was the best action set piece in all of Superhero movie history just truly phenomenal action.The tone of this movie was lighter than I expected after the events of Infinity War I mean it’s not a bad thing, when the movie got dark and serious you felt it. Endgame was part adventure so I guess you’d expect some lighter tones in some aspect. The third act was really the best part of the whole movie and I mean the whole last act, there were some nail biting moments, epic action and wonderful storytelling and heart breaking scenes.So Avengers: Endgame was a really great movie, had awesome characters, an intriguing story, it was fun, had funny humor, fantastic action, really heartbreaking moments and a satisfying conclusion.Sure there were a few things a didn’t like for instance some baffling character decisions or some dragged on scenes but for the most part all I have to say in a nutshell I Thank You Marvel.",5 Abercrombie Circuit Surrey Hills QLD 2226

"These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",93 Adair St Auburn VIC 6084
"Thought this movie was good but a little bit more boring than its predecessor. Some of the ideas were a little wonky and convoluted. The acting was good though, especially from Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. The movie made me cry quite a bit as it was truly the end of an era. Iron Man’s death was brutal, and Tom Holland’s acting during that point made me actually cry. The action and comedy were as good as any Marvel movie. It was a fine ending to a 21 movie long era and the result, while not perfect, checked most of the boxes and was satisfying.",4 Abrahams Crescent Crows Nest VIC 4109
"So... here’s my opinion about Marvels Endgame, and some of you might find it VERY unpopular to say this....I stopped watching marvel movies because of Endgame.I’ve had enough of the MCU. I stopped watching after Ironman and black widow died, Thor retired to go play fortnite (that is not a joke, that is real), and Captain America, the only level headed Avenger left, went back to the past to live out his life with the woman he loves... AND NOT TELL ANYONE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS! Seriously, why didn’t he say anything to Shield all that time, this whole time we’re suppose to believe that their were 2, and at some point 3, Captain America’s that all existed at the same point in time, and he knew what was going to happen years before it actually happened. He could’ve prevented much of the death and disasters that occurred as a result of the events in previous movies, but also better prepared the Avengers by telling them about Thanos years before he got the stones. You would think he would do something like this, but you’d be wrong...There is so much history with these characters... whereas with Falcon, Valkyrie, and... Captain Marvel, they feel kind of like they're known as the side kicks of these superheroes, and therefore don’t hold as much weight as the big 3 imo. Which is a big deal to me because they’re being set up to be the new big 3 in the coming next generation and... Marvel has given me zero reason to care for these characters. I don’t expect them to ever carry as much weight as the OG’s, but they could’ve at least devoted a little more time and character development on these characters and making them as likable as possible.So are they just going to ignore the events of Civil War? Because they did not even mention it at all throughout endgame. It would’ve been at least nice if Tony Stark and kept in America acknowledge that the Civil War happened. Nope, Tony Stark just gives captain his shield back and they just move on with their lives. About Black Widows death:Her death was the same as Gamora’s death. She cracked her skull on pavement a died instantly. And her body was never recovered so they can’t give her a proper burial. I hardly call that a fitting end to a beloved character. You ever wonder why the Russo’s put Hawkeye and Black Widow together? What if they didn’t have a close friendship? Then what? Then they couldn’t get the crystal. And that’s what bothers me about that part, it felt forced in a way. After all the plot devices that held us in disbelief, that brought characters back, why does this have to be the exception? It just feels like bad writing to me.Gamora dying is going to be such a strange thing the Guardians will HAVE to bring up in their new movies, because the Russo's have essentially reset Gamora's character, and if they don't acknowledge that, then what a huge waste of a life that is.I can’t.... it gets me infuriated just talking about it. I am so jaded and numb about the way the original avengers departed, I just don't care about the MCU anymore... And it sucks. I was sorely disappointed by Endgame and it soured my appreciation for ALL of the other MCU movies that preceded it... What a horrible way to end.This movie is a mixed bag, it's got great visuals and some nice eye candy from VFX. It's not really enjoyable to anyone who hasn't watched the other marvel movies. And the story decisions are pretty baffling.",7 A'beckett Street Mitcham  7190
"“I know I said no more surprises, but... I was really hoping to pull off one last one.”After the shocking cliffhanger at the end of ‘Infinity War’, the question that ran through our head’s was “hmm...what just happened?”. Heroes disintegrating out of existence before our very eyes with the last remaining soak up the reality of their failure, and the antagonist finally at peace knowing the monstrous deed is done.‘Avengers: Endgame’ perfectly wraps up 22 movies in a grand and spectacular scale. For a movie that’s three hours long, not once did I feel the length as everything flew by (in my opinion). There's so much going on. The fact this movie even exist and payed off as well as it did, it’s nothing short of a miracle. The Russo Brothers always do a fantastic job directing action and camera work, but little do people mention how they get the best performance out of everyone and really flesh out each character, and I mean every character. I think Black Widow is best handled whenever the Russo’s are involved, in terms of making her dynamic and characterization rather than hard as nails “girl power” trope - that no other director haven’t got the hint yet. I’m also thrilled Hawkeye gets his time to shine, which helps Jeremy Renner work with material to deliver an emotional performance that was pretty hard hitting at times.Same thing with Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-man. It’s incredibly transparent that the Russo Brothers really like this character and doesn't dumb him down to make other characters look good and isn’t just a buffoon. They understand his intelligent and used Scott’s comedic backbone to his advantage. He basically saves the world (besides the rat).Heck, every character gets a great arc, and yes even Thor, which I don’t understand why people argue that he doesn’t. While still having a comedic charm from ‘Thor: Ragnarok’, but when the scene calls for him to be serious, then expect chaos. He really is the strongest and most tragic Avenger. The other main characters also get fantastic and satisfying arcs.Also the acting from everyone was absolutely stellar. Robert Downey Jr. is magnificent as usual, although here it hits home. Chris Evans really grew into the role of Captain America and I can't imagine any other actor playing the part than him. Karen Gillan is often overlooked playing Nebula, as I always thought she nails every role she plays. Despite the heavy make-up, she still can express so much. What's more to say about these actors than best casting ever.The mad titan himself makes a return, but doesn’t have much screen time than “Infinity War” and...well, let’s just say the character goes into an unexpected direction, to say the last. Still a poetic and intimidating villain that can brawl with the avengers with or without the gauntlet. Josh Brolin once again delivers an excellent performance. Thanos is this generation’s Darth Vader.The action sequences are light years more monumental than ‘Infinity War’. If I have to be honest, I shed a tear at the one point towards the final battle. Although the movie isn’t action heavy throughout, but I was never bored during the more slow paced moments.The score from Alan Silvestri﻿ is perhaps the best and most memorable score in the MCU. A mixture of sadness and loss with a booming blast of epic. Perfectly pays tribute to the original six heroes.Now people have complained about the movie having too much fan service, which I personally didn’t mind and couldn’t see the faults, because then again, this entire cinematic universe belongs to them, the fans. The reason why we have 22 movies, 48 hours and 11 minutes worth of movies and this movie pulling in a monster $2 billion worldwide only in 11 days beating ‘Avatar’ that did so in 47 days! While not a stand alone movie, although considering it’s a follow up to the events of “Infinity War”, it would be tricky to do so.For problems: The story had issues throughout and the entire time travel subplot made no sense whatsoever when given a second thought, but then again, how can you make sense of time travel.I didn’t find Captain Marvel solo movie to be all that interesting - both the movie and her as a character, but was hoping the Russo Brothers would resolve that issue and make the character less wooden. Unfortunately even the Russo’s couldn’t save her. Luckily her screen time is incredibly slim, but they literally pulled a Poochie type of excuse when she was absent for a huge amount of the movie’s run time with a “I must go now. My planet needs me”, from ‘The Simpsons’. I must admit, when she did return, I groaned.Overall rating: Despite the problems, ‘Endgame’ still delivers a sweeping epic that leaves the audience feeling whiplash with emotions. Happiness, sadness, joy and excitement. An experience I’ll remember forever.",5 Adamson Crescent Deagon VIC 2263
Overrated and overlong. It needs to be trimmed to 2 hours and it would be much better. Action is good even if there's not enough,227 Abercrombie Circuit Watsonia NSW 3034
I have seen endgame last night and I was blown away by the stupidity of the plot and dialogues. I am not a die hard fan of the franchise but 2:30h of sentimental whining and grieving + 30 minutes of proper action just doesn't work for me.,12 Abrahams Crescent Devonport SA 3128
"After the cullmunation of 21 films and 11 years we are finally here. Avengers Endgame is a Fantastic and Amazing film. Yeah... It's not perfect, but no movie really is.    As a movie i'd give it a 9.9/10    Enjoyment level: 3000/10 Baby",2 Adinda Street Brookfield VIC 3040
"Clown fiesta.The movie broke its own fundamental rules,a rush end to a very successful series of movies.Plot holes cause of bad and lazy scenario.In every Marvel movie so far,you could feel the love for the universe.In Endgame all you feel is a ""let's fill 3 hours and get over with this **** already.Let's just take their money"".If Stan Lee was alive he would be sad.Avengers Endgame should be renamed into Ticket Heist.I wish I could give a - grade,0 is honestly too much",3 Abercorn Crescent Mount Buller  2519
"This one's great. Its the character moments that do it for me. They seem to tie things together well and even unmake a plot hole or two from previous movies (bad news, they're still plot holes in those movies!)Characters acted true to their character, although there was not enough Hulk, Thor was a bit disappointing and Catpan Sparklefingers was as sour and holier than thou as I assume she was in her own movie.",8 Acraman Place Alawa VIC 4113
"That's such an amazing movie, with a deserved outcome! Came to fruition as a film that came to leave the legacy of the original Avengers - who have sacrificed themselves for the common good, in their own way. Gave me goosebumps to the beggining till the end. I love Marvel Studios and love so much this cast and these heroes for life!",12 Adinda Street Abbotsford VIC 3083
"One of the most artless movies I have ever experienced. Movie audiences are becoming more and more (numb, tolerant, enured) to mindless Hollywood spectacles like this, and unfortunately now so are the critics. If this is a standard for movie making, heaven help the movie industry. I can't help but compare it to Game of Thrones (last season not withstanding), and it fails miserably across all standards of comparison. I had absolutely no empathy for any of the characters, except maybe a bit for the bad guy (what was his name.. Thanos?) who seemed weary and forlorn. If you are 15 years old and liked this movie you can be excused for your taste. Otherwise, I think you are probably settling for some really lowbrow Hollywood bird-doodle.",25 A'beckett Street Cashmere QLD 5214
Writing left much to be desired. They really milked the nostalgia. Predictable plot,22 Adcock Place Ringwood North NSW 3226
Expected ending....mixed storyline without proper starting and ending character stories...and what the hell captain marvel did ,79 Acraman Place Yandoit VIC 3219
"While this movie brought me to tears a few times, it was ruined with just a few shots for me at least. Just take the shot where all the women save spiderman. Why? How? When? Where? That was so horrible, it deserved at least two points down for the movie. Another two points down for that Captain Marvel saves everyone moment. Like, really? I still think they should have focused on Scarlet Witch.Those were the points that made the movie average for an MCU movie. However, to be fair, the ending was great. The way they dealt with Ironman and Captain America probably couldn't have been done better. The story line was also great in general.Having said that, I should note that by moving to this political correctness agenda or whatever they want to call it, it is definitely the last MCU movie I will watch in the Cinema.",79 Adinda Street Mount Riverview VIC 4814
I'd rather have bamboo shoots stuck underneath my fingernails than sit through that movie again.,22 Abercorn Crescent Wilmot  3174
"This was probably one of, if not the best, marvel movie I have ever seen. It was both exciting and hilarious, but also emotionally invested in its characters. So in other words, a fitting and well-made conclusion.",14 Abercorn Crescent Yungaburra NSW 
"You sit there waiting for it to start well after the movie begins, shaking your head in disbelief as this unbelievably thin, abominably bad bloated bore ticks on and on!  The same creatives have delivered the same padded plodding overlong junk one entry after another.Once upon a time, superhero movies were made by adults for wide general audiences.  Now they're made by childish nerds for the dumb illiterate global masses who eat up whatever **** Hollywood shovels out!  Marvel, once dramatically clever and incredibly inventive, now puts out uneven unfunny goofy geek comedies.It used to be serious actors balked at comic book fare.  Now they can't take it seriously enough.  The annoying cast in this ridiculous over-the-top series never question the utter lack of narrative talent of its writers, directors and producers, but instead dutifully drone on yucking it up on talk shows and all the way to the bank.  Where's the oversight?!  Disney/Marvel and the rest don't care or know how to make good movies anymore.  They're bean counters on an auto pilot conveyor belt.  There's no restraint whatsoever regarding plausibility.  As absurd as the original grouping of superheroes is (but fun and true to the source, not invalid), they go and pile on every Marvel property including large groupings not even part of The Avengers into a smorgasbord of so many freaking characters slapped together in an endless stupid stream of one liners as excuse for story the result is incoherent plotting (despite its infantile simplicity) and really no emotional investment in any of the characters at all.However big the inflation/population driven box office, this is some very underwhelming STUPID ****",79 Abernethy Street Prospect TAS 7006
It's fantastic movie against all marvel movies. Characters show's their best performance in this one. Keep it up marvel studio...,40 Abbott Street Warriewood VIC 2022
The fight scene in the end was so good it definitely redeemed the past scenes that were a bit slow paced but the overall story is something that will remain remembered forever,2 Ackland Place Toowoomba WA 4036
"A satisfying end to the infinity war saga but the way they did it was also a cheap cop out. Time travel is a cheap way to beat an enemy, albeit the way they handled time travel is refreshing . Marvel could have looked to the comics for inspiration and even extend the thanos/infinity stone saga even more so.This movie is 100% fan service as they close the book on the future of the original avengers bar Hulk.",45 Abbott Street North Ward QLD 2615

"The start of Avengers Endgame leaves every single spectator cold and sympathized locating them in a world after-the-snap where the emptiness that left those who have left and the pain of those who are still, have been present during five long years.Then, The Avengers discover a very risky posibility for bringing everybody back, but our heroes will try it ""Whatever it takes"".Followed by this discovery, Marvel transports us towards a ride through several of the events that ocurred in its cinematographic universe to gather again the infinity gems paying tribute to more than 10 years of films.After this trip that brings with it a very hight cost, we find ourselves with a spectacular and emotive third act full of an overwhelming fan-service that will never be forgotten by its fans, closing masterfully and uniquely the Infinity Saga.The movie came with very high expectations and managed not only to accomplish all of them, but to avercome more than enough them, and Marvel gives fans everything they have dreamed about. The only thing against this film is that it can never be equealed or overcome, locating it on the cusp of Marvel's cinematographic world and leaving too many hight expectations for later films that, even though, we know we'll love them as they always make us do.",45 Adair Street Wahroonga VIC 3047
"Endgame is confusing with their way of time travel like theirs makes more sense, it can be really boring, Nebula is stupid but the ending was cool.",7 Absolon Place Birkdale NSW 6503
"Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of 22 films that I, as well as countless others, have grown up with. This is a character film and takes a deep look at the characters that we have fallen in love with over the past eleven years. It takes its time which can affect the pacing but does it in a way where your time isn't being wasted as a viewer. Everything is important and makes the final scenes so emotional. The acting, editing, sound design, cinematography, & directing are all on their A game and it shows. While this film does have some flaws, like the previously mentioned pacing, no one can deny this is a perfect end. The last hour is some of the most satisfying and emotional scenes you'll see in any comic book film. I couldn't ask for a better send off to so many of my favorite characters!",3 A'beckett Street Berwick VIC 4124

Boring no good humor they f*cked up Thor by being so funny to make him fat hahaha,3 Abernethy Street Burringbar WA 2066

"Endgame es un notable cierre al Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel y a sus 22 películas. Emotiva y épica a parte iguales la cinta dirigida por los hermanos Russo logra en su mayor parte lo que se le pedía con una despedida a la altura para los personajes principales de la saga y para el Universo Marvel, pero a la vez decepciona en algunos aspectos que provocan que no sea un cierre totalmente satisfactorio de lo visto en estos 11 años.",6 Adamson Crescent Deer Park WA 3960

"Quite good, great effects (as expected). It was interesting to see Avengers beaten, broken, a nice phoenix arc.Only downsides are Captain Marvel (damn, that actress is wooden) and one cringy feminist scene, thankfully a very short one.Since many of the best are out/dead (or promised to NOT have a series/movie like Scarlet Witch), I don't think following products will be worth watching. If you are really invested, I would recommend waiting for proper reviews for a few weeks (just ignore ""professional"" critics), or buy it at significant discount.",13 Adair Street Bayswater VIC 2460

"Avengers endgame is a really good movie with great visuals and music, but the movie have some problems, the story is not a incredible well made book, because have some fails like sometimes time travel need to be well made and not be forced to be in the movie, and people that doesn't watch the previous movies, does not understand what is happening sometimes, but is a great movie and a great present for the marvel fans",71 Academy Close Mcdowall VIC 4300
Why is this a 7.8. This movie was amazing it really made me feel something at certain points and concluded the 1st story-line very well. I clapped really hard and I cried really hard.,9 Abbott Street Mill Park WA 2806
"Endgame is a mess. The only positive things that I have to say is the character development, I only like the the character development because of the fact about how many people they have to remember. Now the negative stuff. Let's start off with thor, Thor was so poorly written when he didnt kill thanks who should've been more to determined to fight back instead of being that fat slob we got to know, He should have been motivated to fight back. Black widow. Here is a bit more respect to marvel most of the time I think black widow is wasted but in endgame she had a decent role before she died. Professor hulk,  professor hulk was a nerdy mess the cgi at some points almost made me puke. The pacing was okay, but now the big daddy the plot holes. The plot holes were almost as bad as the ones in captain Marvel here are some I found in the first 30 minutes. Endgame Plot Holes why would fury still be holding on to that pager after 20 yearsHow did the avengers find the pager and bring it back to the compoundPeter quill ship does have a transponder the avengers would recognizeAlso captain marvel doesn't have anything to track a signalWhen a ship runs out of fuel it doesn't just stop it keeps its momentum and keeps going and eventually slows downHow does captain marvel talk and breath in space and survive the vacuum without imploding but in captain marvel she needed a helmetHow did she bring iron man and nebula down to earthNebula when she gets back says she knows thanos s whereabouts but her and Tony have been on the spaceship for weeks and tony told steve he knows nothing Conclusion endgame got a solid 5.",30 A'beckett Street Coolaroo QLD 5290
